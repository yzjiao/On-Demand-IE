        "text": "1.We present FLAIR, an NLP framework designed to facilitate training and distribution ofstate-of-the-art sequence labeling, text classification and language models. The core ideaof the framework is to present a simple, unified interface for conceptually very differenttypes of word and document embeddings. Thiseffectively hides all embedding-specific engineering complexity and allows researchers to“mix and match” various embeddings with little effort. The framework also implementsstandard model training and hyperparameterselection routines, as well as a data fetchingmodule that can download publicly availableNLP datasets and convert them into data structures for quick set up of experiments. Finally, FLAIR also ships with a “model zoo”of pre-trained models to allow researchers touse state-of-the-art NLP models in their applications. This paper gives an overview of theframework and its functionality',\n2.How well can NLP models generalize to a variety of unseen tasks when provided with task instructions? To address this question, we first introduce Super-NaturalInstructions, a benchmark of 1,616 diverse NLP tasks and their expert-written instructions. Our collection covers 76 distinct task types, including but not limited to classification, extraction, infilling, sequence tagging, text rewriting, and text composition. This large and diverse collection of tasks enables rigorous benchmarking of cross-task generalization under instructions—training models to follow instructions on a subset of tasks and evaluating them on the remaining unseen ones.Furthermore, we build Tk-Instruct, a transformer model trained to follow a variety of in-context instructions (plain language task definitions or k-shot examples). Our experiments show that Tk-Instruct outperforms existing instruction-following models such as InstructGPT by over 9% on our benchmark despite being an order of magnitude smaller. We further analyze generalization as a function of various scaling parameters, such as the number of observed tasks, the number of instances per task, and model sizes. We hope our dataset and model facilitate future progress towards more general-purpose NLP models.\n3.Pretrained language models have become the standard approach for many NLP tasks due to strong performance, but they are very expensive to train. We propose a simple and efficient learning framework, TLM, that does not rely on large-scale pretraining. Given some labeled task data and a large general corpus, TLM uses task data as queries to retrieve a tiny subset of the general corpus and jointly optimizes the task objective and the language modeling objective from scratch. On eight classification datasets in four domains, TLM achieves results better than or similar to pretrained language models (e.g., RoBERTa-Large) while reducing the training FLOPs by two orders of magnitude. With high accuracy and efficiency, we hope TLM will contribute to democratizing NLP and expediting its development.",

Ron DeSantis is in a clear second place.Redefining himself to Republican voters, most of whom know him primarily as Trump's vice president, will be a challenge.But the Indiana-bred Pence views his fellow Midwesterners in the Iowa GOP, and their first-in-the-nation caucuses, as a hospitable home for his brand of politics.

        "text": "The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) has confirmed the first three batches of mosquitoes to test positive for West Nile virus in Illinois in 2023, both in Cook County. The North Shore Mosquito Abatement District collected a positive batch of mosquitoes in Evanston on May 30 and the Northwest Mosquito Abatement District collected two positive mosquito batches on May 31 in Park Ridge. The first positive mosquito pool in 2022 was reported on May 24th in Roselle in DuPage County. No human cases of West Nile virus have been reported so far this year. The reports about the first batches of mosquitoes with West Nile virus is a good reminder that this is the time of year when Illinois residents should begin protecting themselves from vector-borne diseases, said IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra. 'We urge everyone -- and especially older people and those with weakened immune systems -- to take precautions to protect themselves and their families from mosquitoes and the viruses they carry by wearing insect repellent and eliminating standing water around their home where mosquitoes breed.”Monitoring for West Nile virus in Illinois includes laboratory tests for mosquito batches, dead birds, as well as testing sick horses and humans with West Nile virus-like symptoms.  People who see a sick or dead crow, blue jay, robin or other perching bird should contact their local county or city health department, which will determine if the bird will be picked up for testing.West Nile virus is transmitted through the bite of a Culex species mosquito, commonly called a house mosquito, that has picked up the virus by feeding on an infected bird.  Common symptoms include fever, nausea, headache and muscle aches.  Symptoms may last from a few days to a few weeks.  Most people infected with West Nile virus will not show any symptoms; however,  in rare cases, severe illness including meningitis, encephalitis, or even death, can occur.  People older than 60 and individuals with weakened immune systems are at higher risk for severe illness from West Nile virus.Last year, 44 counties in Illinois reported a West Nile virus positive mosquito batch, bird, horse, and /or human case. While 34 human cases of West Nile were recorded in 2022, with eight deaths, IDPH notes human cases are underreported and do not reflect the actual number of cases.",

The team got off to a blazing, 21-5 start despite going through the adversity of a last-minute coaching change. And it played some inspiring playoff basketball despite an earlier exit than it had hoped for.Stevens highlighted how the Celtics finished second in the league in both offensive and defensive rating, but also noted that there was some slippage on both ends of the court that proved to be critical during their Eastern Conference Finals matchup with the Miami Heat.The biggest takeaway was the grit that the team displayed, battling back from a 3-2 deficit in the second round to beat the Philadelphia 76ers, and then fighting to stay alive for a full seven-game ECF series with Miami after losing the first three contests.“We have an incredibly resilient group,” Stevens said. “They're tough, with their backs against the wall they are amazing. At the same time, we came up short.”Although the team was outstanding with its back against the wall, there were lapses during less-urgent situations, such as not capitalizing on opportunities to close out Games 1 and 4 against Philadelphia, as well as Games 1 and 2 against Miami.“It's about putting that full 48 together, and that's shared results,” said Stevens. “That's on all of us. It's not just coaches, it's not just players; I look at how can I help everybody do that better, so we all play a role in that and we all have to play better for 48 minutes if we want to win, and every game is worth one in the playoffs. We saw what we were like with our backs against the wall. With the exception of Game 7 (against Miami), we were pretty good.”Ultimately, the Heat played an outstanding series and deserved their NBA Finals berth.

        "text": "Ticks are amongst the important ectoparasites where livestock are concerned, as they adversely affect the animals through bloodsucking. In tropical and subtropical countries, they transmit pathogens such as babesiosis, theileriosis, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis in cattle, causing a reduction in production rate and significant concomitant economic losses. Ticks affect 80% of the cattle population across the world, with an estimated economic loss of USD 20–30 billion per year. In South Africa, economic losses in the livestock industry caused by ticks and tick-borne diseases are estimated to exceed USD 33 million per year (ZAR 500 million). There are seven major genera of ixodid ticks in Southern Africa (i.e., Amblyomma, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Ixodes and Rhipicephalus). The environment in which a tick lives is made up of all the various biological and abiotic factors that are either necessary or unnecessary for its life. The areas where various ticks have been found have been documented in many publications. Using these data, maps of possible species’ habitats can be made. Historical records on tick distribution may be incorrect due to identification mistakes or a change in the tick’s name. All the sources used to generate the maps for this review were unpublished and came from a wide range of sources. To identify tick species and the accompanying microbial ecosystems, researchers are increasingly adopting tick identification methods including 16S and 18S rDNA gene sequencing. Indeed, little is known about the genetic alterations that give important traits, including the predilection for tick hosts, transmission, and acaricide resistance. Opportunities for exploring these changes in tick populations and subpopulations are provided by advancements in omics technologies. The literature on the variety of ixodid ticks, their direct and indirect effects, and control methods in South Africa is compiled in this review.",

Many English learners represent the newest members of our society (including recently arrived immigrants and children of immigrants) who bring a rich diversity of cultural backgrounds and come from families with rich social and linguistic experiences. They also bring skills in their primary languages that contribute enormously to the state’s economic and social strengths as a talented multilingual and multicultural population.\n\nThis policy explicitly focuses on English learners in the context of the state’s efforts to improve the educational system, the quality of teaching and learning, and educational outcomes. It centers on standards, curriculum frameworks, assessment, accountability/school improvement, educator quality, early childhood/preschool, social and family support services, parent/community involvement, and higher education. Its purpose is to promote local capacity-building and continuous improvement in each of these areas and their interrelationship, based on evidence of effectiveness from local experience as well as the most current rigorous research evidence that speaks to the strengths and needs of the diverse population of English learners.\n\nThe impetus for this policy comes from a number of important related developments in California as well as nationally. If properly coordinated and articulated as part of a coherent California English Learner Roadmap, these developments can better serve the state’s large population of English learners to attain college- and career-ready standards and to further promote the rich linguistic diversity of the state as it thrives in a global economy and culture of learning, innovation, and advanced technology.\n\nThe adopted academic State Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards, and corresponding English Language Development (ELD) standards, signal an important shift toward emphasizing academic uses of language for all students, and student engagement with college- and career-ready curriculum using English and other languages. Taken together, these standards highlight the tightly interconnected nature of developing disciplinary content understandings, analytical practices, and academic uses of language for all students. This shift enables the educational system to move beyond remediating students’ English language skills to simultaneously developing their language and literacy skills while engaging in the full range of academic content learning.",

The queries are compared against the keys, and the values corresponding to the matching keys are returned as the output.\n\nWhen the order of the queries is changed, the model may prioritize different keys, which can result in different values being retrieved. For example, if the first query matches a key with a low relevance score and the second query matches a key with a high relevance score, permuting the queries would change the order in which the keys are considered and could lead to a different output.\n\nAdditionally, if the key-value pairs are not unique, permuting the order of the queries may also affect the output. For example, if there are multiple keys that match the same query, the order in which they are considered can affect which value is returned.\n\nOverall, permuting the order of the queries can have a significant impact on the output of the key-value-query model, and it is important to consider the order carefully to ensure that the desired values are retrieved.\n\nWhat rationale is used to motivate the use of attention mechanisms (select all that apply)?\n\n\nWhat rationale is used to motivate the use of attention mechanisms (select all that apply)?\n\n\nWe want to remove the bottleneck of having a fixed, limited-capacity initial decoder state\n\n\nWithout attention mechanisms, the model will be more likely to take into account only the final few words\n\n\nEasier to compute in parallel\n\n\nMany seq2seq tasks like machine translation rely on alignment\nChatGPT\nThe rationales used to motivate the use of attention mechanisms are:\n\nWe want to remove the bottleneck of having a fixed, limited-capacity initial decoder state\nWithout attention mechanisms, the model will be more likely to take into account only the final few words\nMany seq2seq tasks like machine translation rely on alignment\nAttention mechanisms help to address the limitations of traditional sequence-to-sequence models, where the decoder state is fixed and has limited capacity to capture all relevant information from the input sequence. Attention mechanisms allow the decoder to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence, based on their relevance to the current output, and dynamically adjust the decoder state accordingly. This allows the model to handle longer sequences and capture more nuanced relationships between input and output.\n\nWithout attention mechanisms, the model may be more likely to rely on only the final few words of the input sequence, as they are the most recent and have the strongest influence on the final decoder state. Attention mechanisms allow the model to consider all parts of the input sequence, weighted by their relevance to the current output, and produce more accurate and nuanced predictions.\n\nFurthermore, many sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation, rely on aligning the input and output sequences to capture the correct correspondence between words or phrases. Attention mechanisms provide a natural way to incorporate alignment information into the model, allowing it to attend to the relevant parts of the input sequence while generating the output sequence.\n\nFinally, while attention mechanisms can be more computationally expensive than traditional models, they can be computed in parallel and are well-suited to modern hardware, making them scalable and efficient for large-scale applications.",

Increased ocean acidity makes it more difficult for certain organisms, such as corals and shellfish, to build their skeletons and shells. These effects, in turn, could substantially alter the biodiversity and productivity of ocean ecosystems.\n\nChanges in ocean systems generally occur over much longer time periods than in the atmosphere, where storms can form and dissipate in a single day. Interactions between the oceans and atmosphere occur slowly over many months to years, and so does the movement of water within the oceans, including the mixing of deep and shallow waters. Thus, trends can persist for decades, centuries, or longer. For this reason, even if greenhouse gas emissions were stabilized tomorrow, it would take many more years—decades to centuries—for the oceans to adjust to changes in the atmosphere and the climate that have already occurred.",

We summarize the latest developments in vision systems and techniques\nwith examples from various representative studies, including, harvest yield estimation, vineyard management\nand monitoring, grape disease detection, quality evaluation, and grape phenology. We focus on how computer\nvision and machine learning techniques can be integrated into current vineyard management and vinification\nprocesses to achieve industry relevant outcomes. The second component of the paper presents the new\nGrapeCS-ML database which consists of images of grape varieties at different stages of development together\nwith the corresponding ground truth data (e.g., pH and Brix) obtained from chemical analysis. One of the\nobjectives of this database is to motivate computer vision and machine learning researchers to develop\npractical solutions for deployment in smart vineyards. We illustrate the usefulness of the database for a colorbased berry detection application for white and red cultivars and give baseline comparisons using various\nmachine learning approaches and color spaces.

Then expand that to include all the smart tech used by every person, home, building, infrastructure, resource, and service in your street, neighbourhood, and city. There are now billions of IoT devices around the world. Each moment of the day and night, these technologies receive, record, and transmit an unthinkable amount of information, much of which is available to users straight away. The individual is now connected to every other facet of society, such as corporations and government, like never before in history. If harnessed wisely, these smart devices and services can drastically improve residents’ quality of life.\n\nThis leads to the second component of a high-functioning smart city. This other crucial part revolves around governments effectively monitoring, using, and responding to this sea of data and user feedback to boost liveability and resource efficiency for citizens. So, a successful smart city relies not only on the installation of these systems but also on the efforts of administrative and corporate bodies to use them for the public good. The adoption of these strategies and tools is only a means to an end – to better serve the community.\n\nAs a 2018 McKinsey Global Institute report reminds us, the point of becoming a smart city is to “respond more effectively and dynamically to the needs and desires of residents … to optimize the infrastructure, resources, and spaces they share.” The authors also comment that “Asian megacities, with their young populations of digital natives and big urban problems to solve” are rapidly transforming thanks to their “exceptionally high adoption” of smart tech.\n\nThey identify eight key domains where smart cities are making great strides. These broad areas are listed below, with some smart technology examples as taken from the report.\n\nMobility: Real-time public transport updates, smart parking, demand-based microtransit, e-hailing, congestion pricing, predictive maintenance of transportation infrastructure, and real-time road navigations.\nSecurity: Smart surveillance, home security systems, crowd management, emergency response optimisation, real-time crime mapping, and data-driven building inspections.\nHealthcare: Data-based public health interventions (such as sanitisation and child care), infectious disease surveillance, telemedicine, and remote patient monitoring.\nEnergy: Dynamic electricity pricing, smart streetlights, home energy automation systems, and distribution automation systems.\nWater: Water quality monitoring, water consumption tracking, and smart irrigation.\nWaste: Optimisation of waste collection systems, and digital tracking and payment of waste disposal.\nEconomic Development and Housing: Digital land-use and building permitting, business licensing, personalised education, digital business tax filing, and peer-to-peer accommodation platforms.\nEngagement and Community: Digital citizen services, local civic engagement applications, and local connection platforms.\nThe widespread implementation of smart devices enables governing authorities and citizens to collaborate and exchange data in innovative, progressive ways. In the future, we are likely to see more such services and systems integrated into urban development plans.",

        "text": "Conventional supervised binary classification algorithms have been widely applied to address significant research questions using biological and biomedical data. This classification scheme requires two fully labeled classes of data (e.g. positive and negative samples) to train a classification model. However, in many bioinformatics applications, labeling data is laborious, and the negative samples might be potentially mislabeled due to the limited sensitivity of the experimental equipment. The positive unlabeled (PU) learning scheme was therefore proposed to enable the classifier to learn directly from limited positive samples and a large number of unlabeled samples (i.e. a mixture of positive or negative samples). To date, several PU learning algorithms have been developed to address various biological questions, such as sequence identification, functional site characterization and interaction prediction. In this paper, we revisit a collection of 29 state-of-the-art PU learning bioinformatic applications to address various biological questions. Various important aspects are extensively discussed, including PU learning methodology, biological application, classifier design and evaluation strategy. We also comment on the existing issues of PU learning and offer our perspectives for the future development of PU learning applications. We anticipate that our work serves as an instrumental guideline for a better understanding of the PU learning framework in bioinformatics and further developing next-generation PU learning frameworks for critical biological applications.",

We use the Stefan solution and meteorological data from 11 stations to estimate the MTSFG changes from 1961 to 2016 in the Yellow River source region of northwestern China. We employ an antecedent precipitation index model to estimate changes in the liquid soil water content. The marginal posterior probability distributions of the antecedent precipitation index parameters are estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods. We compare the results of our stochastic method with those obtained from the traditional deterministic method and find that they are consistent in general. The stochastic approach is effective for estimating the historical changes in the frozen ground depth (root-mean-square errors = 0.13–0.35 m), and it provides more information on model uncertainty regarding soil moisture variations. Additionally, simulation shows that the MTSFG has decreased by 0.31 cm per year over the last 56 years on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This decrease in frost depth accelerated in the 1990s and 2000s. Considering the lack of data on seasonally frozen soil monitoring, the Bayesian method provides a pragmatic approach to statistically model frozen ground changes using available meteorological data.",

Currently, almost every device intended for medical imaging has a more or less extended image and signal analysis and processing module which can use deep learning. It provides quantitative data necessary to make a diagnosis. The obtained quantitative features must be independent of the inter-subject variability and the type of medical device and, above all, must allow for reproducible results in the presence of high noise. The proposed deep learning algorithms should also ensure the independence of the results obtained by the operator of the imaging device and, to be more exact, its position relative to the patient or the parameter settings in the device. In addition, the proposed deep learning algorithms must be tailored for the diagnosis of a specific disease entity. On the other hand, they must allow for reproducible results for high inter-subject variability. These criteria make it difficult to propose a methodology for the deep learning algorithms. This special issue of BioMedical Engineering Online is dedicated to this area of knowledge.\n3.Open-globe injury is a common cause of blindness clinically caused by blunt trauma, sharp injury, or shock waves, characterised by rupture of the cornea or sclera and exposure of eye contents to the environment. It causes catastrophic damage to the globe, resulting in severe visual impairment and psychological trauma to the patient. Depending on the structure of the globe, the biomechanics causing ocular rupture can vary, and trauma to different parts of the globe can cause varying degrees of eye injury. The weak parts or parts of the eyeball in contact with foreign bodies rupture when biomechanics, such as external force, unit area impact energy, corneoscleral stress, and intraocular pressure exceed a certain value. Studying the biomechanics of open-globe injury and its influencing factors can provide a reference for eye-contact operations and the design of eye-protection devices. This review summarises the biomechanics of open-globe injury and the relevant factors.",

Since 2006, more than 660 attacks on people with albinism in 30 countries have been recorded.\n\n\n\nThe persecution of people with albinism has been identified by the UN as a human rights issue. In countries in Africa, people with albinism are often called zeru zeru, meaning “ghost like creatures.” Too often, they are dehumanized by beliefs that say they are immortal or a curse, and as such, are misunderstood, abandoned, ostracized and sometimes even violently attacked or killed.\n\n\n\nAt more than 170 incidents, Tanzania has the largest recorded number of attacks. But attacks are on the rise in other countries now. Due to myths and superstitions about people with albinism, there is a black market for body parts, hair and skin used by witch doctors in potions and charms. The nature of attacks can range from maiming, to death, to desecrating their graves.\n2.Angolan police shot and killed at least five people in Huambo province on Monday during a taxi drivers’ protest against a recent fuel-price increase. In a statement seen by Human Rights Watch, the Huambo police said “it was not possible to avoid” the killings, as officers tried to contain “acts of violence” by protesters who destroyed properties, confronted the authorities, and used burning tires to block roads.\n\nThe police statement does not explain their use of live bullets against an unarmed crowd. The United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials provides that police use the minimum necessary force at all times. Firearms may only be used to disperse violent assemblies when other less harmful means are not practicable. Law enforcement officers may only intentionally make lethal use of firearms when strictly unavoidable to protect life.\n3.Six women from the Yazidi minority in Iraq were recently rescued with the assistance of the authorities in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and activist Nadia Murad.\n\nThe report says that the women were kidnapped by ISIS in 2014. They were trafficked from Iraq to Syria and were rescued on Saturday. ISIS took over Mosul in Iraq nine years ago in June 2014.\n\nThe Yazidi community lived in numerous villages near Mount Sinjar. ISIS attacked the area in August 2014 and rounded up Yazidis that were unable to flee. While hundreds of thousands of the minority community fled to Sinjar mountain or to Syria, where they were assisted by the Syrian YPG, others were held by ISIS.",

Electricity generation from natural gas increased in the United States this past winter due to increased demand for electricity and continued reductions in electricity generation from coal.\n\nU.S. electricity generation from natural gas peaks in the summer when demand for electricity is greatest—largely driven by demand for air conditioning. A smaller peak occurs during the winter, when homes and businesses in some areas of the country use heat pumps, electric radiators, space heaters, and other electric-heating equipment to heat buildings.\n\nOverall, U.S. electricity generation this past winter was the highest since at least 1997. The increased electricity demand was met by natural gas, wind, and solar—all of which increased their overall electricity generation compared with the previous winter of 2021–22. In contrast, electricity generation from coal decreased compared with the previous winter.\n\n\n2.According to the newly released 2023 Sustainable Energy in America Factbook from the Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE) and BloombergNEF, 2022 was historic in terms of clean energy benchmarks and laudable policy achievements. Despite daunting obstacles, power generation from renewable sources hit a record, consumers purchased nearly 1 million new electric vehicles, and federal legislation allocated at least $369 billion in support of clean energy technologies.

        "text": "1.Nineteen Eighty-Four (also published as 1984) is a dystopian social science fiction novel and cautionary tale by English writer George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society.[2][3] Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian state in the novel on Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany.[2][3][4] More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within societies and the ways in which they can be manipulated.\n\nThe story takes place in an imagined future in the year 1984, when much of the world is in perpetual war. Great Britain, now known as Airstrip One, has become a province of the totalitarian superstate Oceania, which is led by Big Brother, a dictatorial leader supported by an intense cult of personality manufactured by the Party's Thought Police. Through the Ministry of Truth, the Party engages in omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and constant propaganda to persecute individuality and independent thinking.[5]\n\nThe protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent mid-level worker at the Ministry of Truth who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. Smith keeps a forbidden diary. He begins a relationship with a colleague, Julia and they learn about a shadowy resistance group called the Brotherhood. However, their contact within the Brotherhood turns out to be a Party agent, and Smith is arrested. He is subjected to months of psychological manipulation and torture by the Ministry of Love and is released once he has come to love Big Brother.\n2.To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by the American author Harper Lee. It was published in 1960 and was instantly successful. In the United States, it is widely read in high schools and middle schools. To Kill a Mockingbird has become a classic of modern American literature; a year after its release, it won the Pulitzer Prize. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was ten.\n\nDespite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality, the novel is renowned for its warmth and humor. Atticus Finch, the narrator's father, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. The historian Joseph Crespino explains, 'In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its main character, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism.'[1] As a Southern Gothic novel and Bildungsroman, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the Deep South. Lessons from the book emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice.[2] Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets. In 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one 'every adult should read before they die'.[3]\n\nReaction to the novel varied widely upon publication. Despite the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education, literary analysis of it is sparse. Author Mary McDonough Murphy, who collected individual impressions of To Kill a Mockingbird by several authors and public figures, calls the book 'an astonishing phenomenon'.[4] It was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan, with a screenplay by Horton Foote. Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's hometown.\n3.Emma is a novel written by Jane Austen. It is set in the fictional country village of Highbury and the surrounding estates of Hartfield, Randalls and Donwell Abbey, and involves the relationships among people from a small number of families.[2] The novel was first published in December 1815, with its title page listing a publication date of 1816. As in her other novels, Austen explores the concerns and difficulties of genteel women living in Georgian–Regency England. Emma is a comedy of manners.\n\nBefore she began the novel, Austen wrote, 'I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.'[3] In the first sentence, she introduces the title character as 'Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and a happy disposition... had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.'[4] Emma is spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people's lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray.\n\nEmma, written after Austen's move to Chawton, was her last novel to be published during her lifetime,[5] while Persuasion, the last complete novel Austen wrote, was published posthumously.\n\nThe novel has been adapted for a number of films, television programmes and stage plays.",

        "text": "1.This study examines the occurrences rate of geomagnetic storms during the solar cycles (SCs) 20–24. It also investigates the solar sources at SCs 23 and 24. The Disturbed storm time (Dst) and Sunspot Number (SSN) data were used in the study. The study establishes that the magnitude of the rate of occurrences of geomagnetic storms is higher (lower) at the descending phases (minimum phases) of the solar cycle. It as well reveals that severe and extreme geomagnetic storms (Dst < -250 nT) seldom occur at low solar activity but at very high solar activity and are mostly associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) when occurred. Storms caused by CME + CH-HSSW are more prominent during the descending phase than any other phase of the solar cycle. Solar minimum features more CH-HSSW- associated storms than any other phase. It was also revealed that all high intensity geomagnetic storms (strong, severe and extreme) are mostly associated with CMEs. However, CH-HSSW can occasionally generate strong storms during solar minimum. The results have proven that CMEs are the leading cause of geomagnetic storms at the ascending, maximum and the descending phases of the cycles 23 and 24 followed by CME + CH-HSSW. The results from this study indicate that the rate of occurrence of geomagnetic storms could be predicted in SC phases.\n2.The variations of ionospheric Total electron content (TEC) due to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and geomagnetic storms over New Zealand were studied. TEC data were collected from dual-frequency GPS sites operated by the University NAVSTAR Consortium in New Zealand, at Ous2 (−45.86°N, 170.51°E), Dund (−45.89°N, 170.59°E), Mtjo (−43.99°N, 170.46°E), and Quar (−43.53°N, 169.81°E) stations. The findings of this study show that the variability of ionospheric TEC was more noticeable during the main phase of the storm on September 08, 2017 than the initial phase on September 07, 2017, recovery phase on September 09, 2017, and during the CME day on September 06, 2017. Also, the enhancements of change in TEC (\nTEC) were pronounced more over the Mtjo station during the CME day and over the Quar station during the geomagnetic storm day than over other stations. On September 06, 2017, two X-class solar flares, specifically X2.2 and X9.3, were observed with quiet geomagnetic storm conditions throughout the CME day, resulting in an increase in TEC. On September 07, 2017, the M7.3, X1.3, and on September 08, 2017, the X8.1 solar flare classes with disturbed geomagnetic conditions led to a significant enhancement of TEC over the stations at 02:00 UT (13:00 LT).\n3.The effects of solar flares on ionospheric total electron content (TEC) over Iceland before and during the geomagnetic storm of September 8, 2017 were studied. Global Positioning Syste (GPS)-TEC data were obtained from dual-frequency GPS sites operated by the University NAVSTAR Consortium at Dyna (65.06°N, −16.6°E) and Kisa (64.7°N, −17.6°E) stations. The findings of this study show that the enhancement of ionospheric TEC was more noticeable over the Kisa station than over the Dyna station during the coronal mass ejection day. However, during the geomagnetic storm day, maximum enhancement of TEC was observed over the Dyna station than over the Kisa station. The values of the ionospheric TEC during the initial phase of the storm were greater than during the main and recovery phases of the storm over both stations. This might be due to the effects of X-class solar flares and shock wave preceding the arriving of interplanetary coronal mass ejections plasma.",

And there is a significant chance that a recession would make things much worse. In the event of a recession (which Deloitte rates at a 35% probability), the economy would contract, and unemployment would rise. \nInflation has lowered consumers' purchasing power despite gains in nominal income due to the strong labor market. Even though nominal average weekly earnings have increased by 8.3% since December 2020, real earnings have fallen by 5%.8 This will weigh on consumer demand and, hence, retail sales volume. \nConsumer spending9 on services has been picking up steadily as consumers return to bars and restaurants, take vacations, and enjoy sporting events as they did before the pandemic. To some extent, consumers are dipping into their savings to make up for what they missed during 2020-2021. The personal saving rate is now at 3.1%, much lower than pre-pandemic levels. A shift in spending to services will therefore weigh on retail sales at stores selling consumer goods. \n3.The United States’ retail market saw healthy expansion in 2022, with sales volume reaching $102 billion and over 80,000 transactions closing, pushing investors to continue planting capital in this sector. The average annual retail sales volume in the U.S. is $54.3 billion, with a record-high retail sales volume of $111.4 billion in a single year. 2022 saw a near-record high value due to the cost of goods going up, rent increases, and developers expanding. In the third quarter of 2022, $23 billion of retail properties traded hands, which is approximately 4.5 percent higher than the year prior. As inflation continues to rise, landlords are asking more for rents, increasing year-over-year rent costs by 3.9 percent, the fastest increase in one singular year in over a decade. On top of that, average triple net asking rents are sitting at $24 per square foot, a new high. New retail construction is limited which has transitioned to more adaptive reuse occurring in the sector, which a majority of construction being single tenant build-to-suit. Overall, the retail market was healthy in 2022, however the sector is expected to face headwinds in 2023.",

It is a very common antibiotic that is active against an extensive range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. It is used to treat certain varieties of bacterial infections, like gonorrhea and infections of the urinary, intestinal and respiratory tracts. In the present effort, quantum chemical calculations of molecular geometries (bond lengths and bond angles) and bonding features of the monomer and dimer of ampicillin trihydrate in the ground state have been carried out due to its biological and industrial importance\n2.An approach called topography and recognition imaging (TREC) uses a ligand (such as an antibody, a small organic molecule or a nucleotide), bound to a carefully designed AFM tip-sensor, to estimate affinity and structural data through a series of unbinding experiments [4]. If a ligand is attached to the end of an AFM probe, one can simulate various physiological conditions and look at the strength of the interaction between the ligand and receptor in a wide range of circumstances. By functionalizing the tip, it can be used to probe biological systems and to identify particular chemical entities on the surface of a biological sample. This opens the door to more-effective uses of AFM in drug discovery.\n3.The process for drug discovery and development is challenging, time consuming and expensive. Computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools can act as a virtual shortcut, assisting in the expedition of this long process and potentially reducing the cost of research and development. Today CADD has become an effective and indispensable tool in therapeutic development. The human genome project has made available a substantial amount of sequence data that can be used in various drug discovery projects. Additionally, increasing knowledge of biological structures, as well as increasing computer power have made it possible to use computational methods effectively in various phases of the drug discovery and development pipeline. The importance of in silico tools is greater than ever before and has advanced pharmaceutical research. Here we present an overview of computational methods used in different facets of drug discovery and highlight some of the recent successes. In this review, both structure-based and ligand-based drug discovery methods are discussed.

It's one of the most obvious ways that El Niño, which is a natural climate pattern, exacerbates the effects of climate change, which is caused by humans burning fossil fuels and releasing greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. \n \nBut temperature superlatives obscure the bigger trend: the last 8 years were the hottest ever recorded, despite a persistent La Niña that took hold in late 2020 and only just ended, depressing global temperatures.

        "text": "1.Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968). In 1963, the character founded the Avengers superhero team with Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk.\n\nA wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward 'Tony' Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man.\n\nInitially, Stan Lee used Iron Man to explore Cold War themes, particularly the role of American technology and industry in the fight against communism. Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have shifted to contemporary matters.[1]\n\nIron Man has headlined various comic book series. Throughout most of the character's publication history, he has been a founding member of the Avengers.\n\n2.The Snow Queen is a 2012 Russian 3D computer-animated fantasy adventure family film written by Vadim Sveshnikov and directed by Vladlen Barbe and Maxim Sveshnikov. The Snow Queen was produced by Wizart Animation and released by Bazelevs. InlayFilm acted as co-production studio. The film is a remake of the 1844 story of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen. The film was produced by Timur Bekmambetov, Alexander Ligaiy, Yuri Moskvin, Sergey Rapoport and Olga Sinelshchikova.\n\n\nThe Snow Queen was one of the most anticipated projects of the Russian film industry in 2012. Inspirational evaluation of The Snow Queen at international film markets set its stage for international distribution. The film was released on 31 December 2012 in Russia. In the United States, it was released on 11 October 2013. After receiving generally positive reviews from critics, an Annecy International Animated Film Festival review noted the film's ambition is reminiscent of the golden age of Russian animation. The film also achieved significant commercial success, earning 233 million rubles domestically while total box office amounted to $13.6 million, nearly doubling its $7 million budget. The film became a milestone in the history of Russian animation as it received accolades from Moscow Film Festival and Zelenograd International Youth Film Festival.\n3.Titanic is a 1997 American epic romance and disaster film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of RMS Titanic and stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. The film also features Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, and Bill Paxton.\n\nUpon its release on December 19, 1997, Titanic achieved significant critical and commercial success, and then received numerous accolades. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly DiCaprio, Winslet, and Stuart), production values, Cameron's direction, musical score, cinematography, story, and emotional depth. Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it tied All About Eve (1950) for the most Oscar nominations, and won 11, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben-Hur (1959) for the most Oscars won by a single film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It remained the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's next film, Avatar, surpassed it in 2010. A number of re-releases since 1997 have pushed the film's worldwide total to $2.257 billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide (after Avatar). It was also selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 2017 for being 'culturally, historically or aesthetically significant'",

He added the company is facing macroeconomic challenges in digital advertising and mobile gaming, which is part of Apple’s services business.\n\nThe highlight of Apple’s report was iPhone sales, which grew from the year-ago quarter even as the broader smartphone industry contracted nearly 15% during the same time, according to an IDC estimate.  \n\nIPhone revenue increased 2% during the quarter that ended April 1, suggesting that parts shortages and supply chain issues that had hampered the product for the last few years — including an iPhone factory shutdown late last year — had finally abated.  \n\n“It was quite a good quarter from an iPhone point of view, particularly relative to the market when you look at the market stats,” Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach.",

It summarizes cases in Australia, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and Spain. An appendix to this report identifies other countries we researched to locate pharmaceutical antitrust cases since 2010 that involved fines or other sanctions, but where no such cases were found, namely Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, and Sweden. The appendix provides information regarding antitrust regulation and enforcement in these countries. In Australia, one case is currently in progress regarding cartel-like behavior, specifically, that a company fixed prices, rigged bidding prices, and restricted supply of a pharmaceutical ingredient used to manufacture generic drugs. The company has pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing. In Spain, Merck Sharp & Dohme was fined more than 38.9 million euros for abuse of its dominant position regarding actions taken to prevent another company from marketing a product similar to the Nuvaring contraceptive. In France, four cases are identified, most notably in 2020 against Novartis Group and Roche Group, where they were found to have provided misleading and alarmist information regarding the safety of Avastin, a cheaper product for treating age-related macular degeneration, in favor of their more expensive drug, Lucentis. The companies were fined a combined 444.8 million euros (US$455,926,672). In Denmark, while no instances were found where pharmaceutical companies were fined for violations of competition rules, cases were found in which companies were ordered to cease non competitive actions, including one on misuse of dominant market position to raise prices and another on improper coordination to limit competition.",

        "text": "Remediation of toxic pollutants is an important process to protect human health and the environment by eliminating or mitigating the harmful effects of these substances. Various methods are available for remediating toxic pollutants, depending on the type and severity of contamination. Here are some common techniques which were reported in this research Topic: 1) Bioremediation: This technique uses living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and plants, to break down, remove, or neutralize contaminants in soil, water, and air. The organisms may be naturally occurring or genetically engineered to enhance their remediation capabilities.2) Chemical treatment: Chemicals react with pollutants, neutralizing or transforming them into less harmful substances. Examples include oxidation, reduction, precipitation, and neutralization processes.3) Phytoremediation: This technique uses plants to absorb, accumulate, or break down pollutants in the soil, water, or air. Some plants, such as sunflowers, are particularly effective at extracting heavy metals and other contaminants.-Zhao et al. reported that foliar silicon (Si) spraying could reduce rice's cadmium (Cd) contamination, but different rice varieties respond differently. Si-inhibited varieties show a decrease in Cd content by 13.5%-65.7%, while Si-stimulated varieties experience an increase of 15.7%-24.1%. This highlights the importance of considering rice variety differences when implementing foliar Si spraying to remediate Cd-contaminated paddy fields.-Lei et al. reported silicon's role in mitigating cadmium toxicity in plants. Silicon helps reduce cadmium uptake and transport, improves nutrient supply, regulates antioxidant systems, and enhances physical plant structure. The review specifically focuses on silicon's role in maintaining water balance and suggests future research directions.-Huang et al. duckweed have phytoremediation ability and stated that high streptomycin concentrations negatively impact duckweed health, reducing biomass and growth rate while increasing antioxidative enzymes. However, duckweed demonstrates a high ability to remove streptomycin from the environment, with significant reductions observed after 20 days. This suggests that duckweed could be a valuable resource for treating aquaculture wastewater and domestic sewage contaminated with streptomycin.-Zhu et al. stated that antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidants increased with Pb concentration, while peroxidase and the ascorbic acid-glutathione cycle showed mixed results. Through transcriptome sequencing, 17 root Pb-tolerant genes were identified, associated with antioxidation, transportation, and transcription functions.-Hafeez et al. reported that different plant hosts affected the bio-detoxification of insects differently by affecting the gene expression of a specific gene. This not only affects the efficiency of an insecticide against a pest but could also contribute to the development of insecticide resistance. The results suggested that the P450 enzyme system helps the herbivores ad",

Significant stressors include recent job loss and subsequent financial struggles. Recommended CBT and possible medication evaluation if symptoms persist.\nMr. Davis, a 48-year-old man, came forward with symptoms that are consistent with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Over the course of the past two months, he has been consistently experiencing a pervasive feeling of sadness, lack of interest in activities (anhedonia), feelings of worthlessness, difficulty concentrating, and recurrent thoughts of death. He is also struggling with insomnia and unintentional weight loss, indicating potential disruptions in his physical well-being. He denied any history of substance use or thoughts of suicide. Notably, Mr. Davis has recently undergone significant life changes, such as a divorce and a job change, which appear to have coincided with the onset of his symptoms. The recommended treatment plan includes psychotherapy, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT), the possibility of medication, and a referral for group support. Mr. Davis showed a positive attitude towards these suggestions and demonstrated willingness to engage in treatment.\nInterviewed Mr. Lopez, 36, with a history of mood swings, impulsive decisions, and unstable relationships. Discussed periods of elevated mood, increased activity levels, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, and engaging in activities with potential for painful consequences. Bipolar Disorder possibly indicated. Discussed management strategies including mood stabilizers, psychoeducation, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Informed consent given for further diagnostic assessment and treatment planning.\nToday's session was with Miss Taylor, a vibrant 25-year-old who works as a software engineer. The picture, however, wasn't always as bright; she detailed a complex history involving intermittent periods of intense worry, restlessness, and physical symptoms such as heart palpitations and shortness of breath. These episodes of heightened anxiety were prevalent enough to interfere with her work and social life, suggesting a potential diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Despite the distress, she showed resilience and a desire to seek help. Treatment discussions centered around cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques, and the possibility of medication if non-pharmacological interventions are insufficient. She left the session hopeful and prepared to begin therapy.",

        "text": "On Friday afternoon, February 3, 2019, at 2 p.m. in ABC Shipping Co. located in 13th Avenue, Applewood, one of the warehouse workers (John Keegan) slipped and fell while carrying heavy (85 lbs) inventory. The root cause is believed to be the unavailability of a hand truck or pallet jack. Instead of waiting, John attempted carrying the load himself. A second possible cause is the condition of John’s PPE, specifically his boots, which are very worn in certain places. When John fell, his colleagues rushed to his assistance. Suspecting a fracture, the supervisor on the floor (Kathy Pickens) decided to call 911. John said he felt a bit dizzy when he lost his balance and that he just ‘tripped over his feet.’ He tried to minimize damage to the load itself while falling, which may have led to a more awkward fall. Two of his co-workers said that they noticed he was struggling a bit before the fall, but were busy with their own tasks and felt it would be rude to ‘call him out.’ See the attached witness statements for more info. John was taken to a nearby hospital and a fracture to his wrist was confirmed. John will be out of work for a number of weeks. The supervisor is currently working with the safety officer (Chris Darnell) to assess the condition of the floor, the number and condition of hand trucks and pallet jacks on the floor, as well as the condition of company-provided boots over two years old. \n Josh Lee, a freight handler in XYZ Shipping Lines, was exposed to carbon monoxide fumes on December 2, 2017, Tuesday, from (estimated) 7:30 AM to 11:30 AM. He was at the unloading bay B, helping unload some freight from various containers with the help of two forklift operators: Kit Stevens and Donald Summers, neither of which complained of symptoms. During unloading, Lee suddenly experienced lightheadedness and nausea. He informed his supervisor (Donna Martin) that he thought he was ill. Martin noticed his symptoms were consistent with CO exposure, so she walked over to the area and felt the air quality seemed off. She ran a sensor (Portable Direct Reading Monitor) and discovered that CO levels were on the high end but within the acceptable limit: 30 PPM. Stevens and Summers were ordered to turn off powered vehicles and sit in fresh air for an hour while the ventilation system could be examined (see attached report). Lee was driven to the hospital by Martin to receive treatment. On the way, he complained of blurred vision briefly but said that it had cleared up upon walking into the ER. A full report will be attached once received. Lee’s colleagues, Stevens and Summers, didn’t notice anything out of the norm with the air quality, but Summers acknowledged that at 11:00 AM, his vehicle had been left running near the open end of a container for thirty minutes while Lee was adjusting two improperly arranged pallets just inside. There is no air quality data from that time.",

Listen! “Listeners” is garbage, and in most cases, I’d say you’d have to see it to believe it but I pray no one besides myself has to lay themselves bare to this level of unfiltered drek. If the litmus test for a half-decent anime screen-writer is having listened to the musical stylings of Jimi Hendrix, Prince, and Pink Floyd (among many...many others), then you can consider most dads in the continental United States accomplished enough to pen something equal to or better than Listeners.

The story is curious and weird honestly. When you think it's gonna go into one direction, it goes into a different direction. Not that it's bad, but more it's different that makes it good, but certainly not great. While the art style is defo different and unique. It's certain not bad for starters.

It's not a 9 either, but it's definitely more than a 5.8. My first thought was that the start of this show was giving me some serious Diebuster vibes. Others have said Eureka 7 which I haven't watched and couldn't confirm or deny. It kinda reminds me of late 90s - early 2000s semi-episodic anime with a over-arching plot but episodic characters. The show has a great atmosphere. I think. I'm not quite sure because ... \n This is a love song to music nerds in anime form. To say it would be hard to do an anime that I am more of the target audience for would be an understatement. This IS my sort of thing. The level of love put into each episode and all the easter eggs for a music nerd for various rock music of the 90s era and before is beyond ridiculous.

What i expected out of this anime was an epic tale about two kids restoring music to its former glory. Instead, I got... I don't even know what I got. I don't understand why, but this anime's so god damn boring. I was bored through the first episode but decided to give the second episode a shot at redemption, but it just put me right to sleep. Apparently, it's a mecha anime(?) and μ has the power to pilot the mechs because she has a giant headphone jack in her back, and Echo is a mech designing hobbyist. It sounds cool, but there's really just something off that I just can't understand. And if you're looking for cool mecha fight scenes, there's none of that. It's absolutely ruined with crappy cgi.

The soil moisture level is at 60%, which is at the upper limit of the optimal range, ensuring that the crops have ample water. The soil pH is well within the ideal range for most crops, standing at 6.7. The temperature of the soil is 21°C, which is a conducive environment for the growth and development of plant roots. Nutrient levels are marked as adequate, indicating balanced levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium - essential elements for plant growth. Crop-related readings show healthy growth with an average crop height of 62 cm, a leaf area index of 3.2, and a Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) of 0.35. The Chlorophyll Concentration Index (CCI) is 34.6, suggesting robust photosynthesis activity. Weather conditions also seem favorable with an ambient temperature of 23°C, 45% relative humidity, a wind speed of 12 km/h, and solar radiation of 500 W/m². No rainfall was recorded on this date. Overall, no alerts have been triggered, affirming that the farm is maintaining a conducive environment for crop cultivation. \n Based on the sensor logs from XYZFarm001 on July 1, 2023, the soil conditions indicate that the farm is within the optimal range for successful crop growth. The soil moisture level is at 32%, which falls within the desired range of 25-35%. The pH level of 6.8 is also within the recommended range of 6.0-7.0, ensuring the soil's suitability for crop cultivation. The soil temperature stands at 24.5°C, providing favorable conditions for plant development. Additionally, the nutrient levels in the soil are adequate, with nitrogen (N) at 42 ppm, phosphorus (P) at 18 ppm, and potassium (K) at 35 ppm. These values suggest that the soil is well-balanced in terms of essential nutrients, supporting healthy crop growth. Regarding crop growth, the farm is currently cultivating corn (Zea mays) in its vegetative stage (V7). This stage marks the development of the seventh leaf, indicating that the corn plants are actively growing and establishing a strong foundation. The vegetative stage is crucial for plant growth as it focuses on leaf development and the accumulation of energy reserves, which are vital for future reproductive stages and overall yield. With favorable soil conditions, the corn crop at XYZFarm001 is expected to continue thriving and progress through subsequent growth stages. Please note that these logs provide a snapshot of the farm's conditions on a specific date and may vary over time due to various factors such as weather patterns, crop management practices, and natural variations in soil composition. \n On August 10, 2023, at 8:00 AM, the farm sensor logs indicated that Field A, Row 1 had a soil moisture reading of 45% and a soil pH reading of 6.2.

        "text": "Fashion has always been known to push the envelope. With new trends and ideas, fashion has an eye towards the future. The fashion industry will see huge amounts of innovation in coming years as new technology and changing customer trends and demands will transform the industry \n Here are three changes to expect in the future of fashion:  \n 1 . Data-Driven \n It used to be that consumers wore whatever designers created. Those days are over, and fashion brands now use data to understand customer preferences, monitor their shopping behavior and create products that meet their needs. The future of fashion is data-driven: by leveraging data on consumer trends, brands can create pieces consumers are most likely to purchase. Many stores and brands, including Miu Miu and Stitch Fix, use data to predict the rise and fall of trends. Predictive analytics consider everything from climate to color preferences, social media trends and political movements. The benefits of using data in fashion are numerous: from only producing pieces consumers will actually wear to reducing waste and connecting the right consumers with pieces they will enjoy. Data also helps brands run more efficiently, giving them room to innovate and balance supply and demand. 2 . Sustainable \n Fashion has long been one of the biggest contributors to waste and climate change, largely because of its unsustainable and non-eco-friendly production methods. But the tides are changing, and brands are moving towards more sustainable fabrics and manufacturing methods. Research shows that 88% of consumers want brands to help them be more environmentally friendly. Even with its strides, fashion has a long way to go. Fashion production releases 10% of the world’s carbon emissions, more than international flights and maritime shipping combined. A number of sustainable fashion brands are growing, and their innovative practices are becoming more commonplace among retailers. British design company Vin + Omi harvests its own crops to make clothing from horseradish plants and chestnuts. It also features clothing items made from recycled paint containers. Levi’s recently unveiled a new collection of denim that uses 96% less water to create—a major win for clothing that notoriously requires a lot of water to produce.  \n 3 . Digital \n The future of fashion is happening online, and brands will have to adjust how they create and sell clothing to make it work in a digital world.  \n With more shoppers taking advantage of online shopping, fashion retailers have to follow suit. Aside from changing Covid-19 restrictions, consumers increasingly prefer the convenience and speed of online shopping, even if it means not being able to try an item on in person. The most successful fashion brands of the future won’t just make their clothing available online—they will also create an immersive digital shopping experience with things like virtual fit or sizing tools, virtual showrooms and virtual stylists. Fashion brands will also leverage technology like AR and VR to allow consumers to “try on” items digitally from the comfort of their own homes. Major retailers like Adidas, Macy’s and Modcloth are adopting virtual dressing rooms and bringing the technology mainstream. Using AR to virtually try on items helps consumers stay more confident in their purchases and reduces return rates by 36%.",

        "text": "The Battle of Plassey was a decisive victory of the British East India Company over the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies on 23 June 1757, under the leadership of Robert Clive. The victory was made possible by the defection of Mir Jafar, who was Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah's commander in chief. The battle helped the British East India Company take control of Bengal. Over the next hundred years, they seized control of most of the rest of the Indian subcontinent, including Burma. \n The battle took place at Palashi (Anglicised version: Plassey) on the banks of the Hooghly River, about 150 kilometres (93 mi) north of Calcutta (now Kolkata) and south of Murshidabad in West Bengal, then capital of Bengal Subah. The belligerents were the British East India Company, and the Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal. He succeeded Alivardi Khan (his maternal grandfather). Siraj-ud-Daulah had become the Nawab of Bengal the year before, and he had ordered the English to stop the extension of their fortification. Robert Clive bribed Mir Jafar, the commander-in-chief of the Nawab's army, and also promised to make him Nawab of Bengal. Clive defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah at Plassey in 1757 and captured Calcutta.[2]\n The War of the Spanish Succession was a European great power conflict that took place from 1701 to 1715. The death of childless Charles II of Spain in November 1700 led to a struggle for control of the Spanish Empire between his heirs, Philip of Anjou and Charles of Austria, and their respective supporters, among them Spain, Austria, France, the Dutch Republic, Savoy and Great Britain. Related conflicts include the 1700–1721 Great Northern War, Rákóczi's War of Independence in Hungary, the Camisards revolt in southern France, Queen Anne's War in North America and minor trade wars in India and South America. \n Although weakened by over a century of continuous conflict, Spain remained a global power whose territories included the Spanish Netherlands, large parts of Italy, the Philippines, and much of the Americas, which meant its acquisition by either France or Austria potentially threatened the European balance of power. Attempts by Louis XIV of France and William III of England to resolve the issue through diplomacy were rejected by the Spanish and Charles II named Louis' grandson, Philip of Anjou, as his heir. His proclamation as king of an undivided Spanish Empire on 16 November 1700 led to war, with France and Spain on one side and the Grand Alliance on the other. The First Javanese War of Succession was a struggle between Sultan Amangkurat III of Mataram and the Dutch East India Company who supported the claim of the Sultan's uncle, Pangeran Puger to the throne. \n Amangkurat II died in 1703 and was briefly succeeded by his son, Amangkurat III. The Dutch believed they had found a more reliable client in his uncle Pangeran Puger. Tensions increased when Amangkurat was accused of giving refuge to the rebel Surapati.[4] Pangeran Puger accused Amangkurat before the Dutch of planning an uprising in East Java. Unlike Pangeran Puger, Amangkurat III inherited blood connection with Surabayan ruler, Jangrana II, from Amangkurat II and this lent credibility to the allegation that he cooperated with the now powerful Untung Surapati in Pasuruan. Panembahan Cakraningrat II of Madura, VOC’s most trusted ally, persuaded the Dutch to support Pangeran Puger. Pangeran Puger took the title of Pakubuwana I upon his accession in June 1704.",

        "text": "Sea snakes, or coral reef snakes, are elapid snakes that inhabit marine environments for most or all of their lives. They belong to two subfamilies, Hydrophiinae and Laticaudinae. Hydrophiinae also includes Australasian terrestrial snakes, whereas Laticaudinae only includes the sea kraits (Laticauda), of which three species are found exclusively in freshwater. If these three freshwater species are excluded, there are 69 species of sea snakes divided between seven genera. \n Most sea snakes are venomous, except the genus Emydocephalus, which feeds almost exclusively on fish eggs. Sea snakes are extensively adapted to a fully aquatic life and are unable to move on land, except for the sea kraits, which have limited land movement. They are found in warm coastal waters from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and are closely related to venomous terrestrial snakes in Australia.[4] \n Sea turtles (superfamily Chelonioidea), sometimes called marine turtles, are reptiles of the order Testudines and of the suborder Cryptodira. The seven existing species of sea turtles are the flatback, green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and olive ridley sea turtles.[4] All of the seven species listed above, except for the flatback, are present in US waters, and are listed as endangered and/or threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The flatback itself exists in the waters of Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.[5] Sea turtles can be categorized as hard-shelled (cheloniid) or leathery-shelled (dermochelyid).[6] The only dermochelyid species of sea turtle is the leatherback. \n Pinnipeds (pronounced /ˈpɪnɪˌpɛdz/), commonly known as seals,[a] are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous, fin-footed, semiaquatic, mostly marine mammals. They comprise the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the walrus), Otariidae (the eared seals: sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (the earless seals, or true seals). There are 34 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora; their closest living relatives are musteloids (weasels, raccoons, skunks, and red pandas), having diverged about 50 million years ago.\n The Sirenia (/saɪˈriːni.ə/ say-REE-nee-ə), commonly referred to as sea cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. The extant Sirenia comprise two distinct families: Dugongidae (the dugong and the now extinct Steller's sea cow) and Trichechidae (manatees, namely the Amazonian manatee, West Indian manatee, and West African manatee) with a total of four species.[2] The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct. Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago (mya). The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene (30–35 mya). \n Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. As an informal and colloquial grouping, they correspond to large members of the infraorder Cetacea, i.e. all cetaceans apart from dolphins and porpoises. Dolphins and porpoises may be considered whales from a formal, cladistic perspective. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest non-cetacean living relatives are the hippopotamuses, from which they and other cetaceans diverged about 54 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have had their last common ancestor around 34 million years ago. Mysticetes include four extant (living) families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale). Odontocetes include the Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales), as well as the six families of dolphins and porpoises which are not considered whales in the informal sense.",

Citybase Apartments has listed the destinations that, due to climate change, tourist damage and natural erosion, may be extinct in 100 years’ time. \n The Taj Mahal is almost 400 years old and its famous façade is struggling with age, leading local authorities to ban cars from the area to reduce pollution. The mausoleum is losing its pearly sheen due to acid rain and air pollution and the volume of tourists each year are wearing down the marble walls and floors. The wooden foundations of the building are also straining and are affected by the falling water levels of the polluted Yamuna River nearby. \n Since Machu Picchu was declared a Unesco World Heritage site in 1983 tourists have braved altitude sickness to see the ancient ruins at Cuzco. But the volume of people is causing damage to the Inca City. As the area around the site has built up, so have problems with deforestation, the risk of landslides and uncontrolled urban development. From 1 July Peru’s Ministry of Culture will only allow access to visitors who have pre-booked tickets to ensure the number does not exceed 2,500 per day. It also lies on the Tambomachay Fault so could be hit by an earthquake. \n The retreating glaciers in the French Alps have lost 5m of snow each year for the last three decades due to the effects of global warming. The most alarming scientific predictions say that the glaciers will disappear completely by 2050 if the earth’s temperature continues to increase at its current rate. Analysis shows that the ice above 3,800 metres on the Mont Blanc massif is relatively stable, but below that it’s retracting quite quickly. The Brenva glacier on the Italian side loses around 12m of ice per year, while the Mer de Glace in Chamonix loses 4 to 5m per year on average and is now considerably thinner in depth as well. \n Mount Kilimanjaro is famous for the snowy cap on its Kibo summit, but approximately 85 per cent of the glacial ice on Mount Kilimanjaro disappeared between 1912 and 2011 according to a report by NASA. The glaciers, thought to be 10,000 years old, lost more than 4,000,000 cubic meters of ice in the past 13 years and predictions say the cap will have completely disappeared by 2033. \n A third of the famous Great Wall of China has disappeared due to a combination of natural erosion, brick theft to build houses and tourist damage. Construction on the wall first began in the 3rd century BC, but nearly 6,300km was built during the Ming era between 1368 and 1644. Some of the construction has simply weathered away, while plants growing in the walls have accelerated the decay. Chinese authorities have also had issues with tourists etching graffiti on the stone structure.",

Lastly, switch to a big spoon and stir in the flour, just until combined. Some lumps are ok! If you’re adding any additional mix-ins, gently fold them in now. \n Pour the batter into your greased loaf pan and sprinkle lightly with cinnamon. If you’d like a pretty swirled effect, run the tip of a knife across the batter in a zig-zag pattern. \n Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (typically, if I haven’t added any mix-ins, my bread is done at 55 minutes; if I have added mix-ins, it needs closer to 60 minutes). Let the bread cool in the loaf pan for 10 minutes, then carefully transfer the bread to a cooling rack to cool for 20 minutes before slicing. \n  \n TURKEY + CARROT ROLL-UP: Place the tortilla on a cutting board. \n Spread the hummus over the entire surface of the tortilla. \n On the bottom 2/3 of the tortilla, sprinkle the carrots.

The top 1/3 section of hummus will act like glue to help the tortilla stay in place.  \n  Cut into 1-inch sections. \n  \n Strawberry Applause: In a large stockpot, bring the cherries, water, cinnamon, and vanilla to a boil. Reduce to a simmer over medium-low heat, cover, and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. \n Add in the strawberries and stir. Cover and then cook for another 15 minutes.

Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa. Roses prefer full sun (at least 6 hours a day) and well-draining soil. The best time to plant roses is in the early spring after the last frost, or in the fall at least six weeks before the average first frost in your area. Roses are susceptible to a number of disease and insect pests. Regular inspections of plants are key to the early detection of any problems.\n Bleeding Heart is a fascinating perennial known for its unique, heart-shaped blooms. Its botanical name, Lamprocapnos spectabilis, hints at its spectacular display, with 'spectabilis' translating to 'remarkable.' The plant is often admired for its pendulous pink or white flowers, which intriguingly resemble a 'bleeding heart.' The blooms are lined neatly on arching stems, forming an elegant drooping effect that is truly stunning in spring gardens. Bleeding Heart plants typically thrive in USDA hardiness zones 3 to 9 and prefer the cool, moist conditions of early spring for planting. Bleeding Heart carries significant symbolic weight.

        "text": "Frédéric François Chopin (1810-1849) was a Polish composer and virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era known for his innovative, expressive, and lyrically intense piano compositions. His musical output, characterized by rich chromaticism and sophisticated harmonic structures, primarily consisted of pieces for solo piano like Nocturnes (e.g., Nocturne in E-flat Major, Op. 9, No. 2), Preludes (e.g., \"Raindrop Prelude\"), Ballades (e.g., Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23), and Polonaises (e.g., \"Heroic Polonaise\"). Born in Poland, he spent most of his productive life in Paris, significantly influencing the future of piano music with his poetic depth and emotional expressivity, thereby securing his status as one of the most performed and universally admired composers in the classical canon. \nJohann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period, revered for his technical command, artistic beauty, and intellectual depth. His expansive oeuvre encompasses various musical forms ranging from concertos, orchestral suites, and sonatas to cantatas, passions, and fugues, making notable contributions to virtually every genre of the period except opera. Renowned works such as the Brandenburg Concertos, the Goldberg Variations, the Mass in B minor, and The Well-Tempered Clavier, showcase his ability to blend profound expressiveness with intricate musical architecture. Bach's mastery of counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organization, along with his adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France, have cemented his reputation as one of the greatest composers in Western music history. Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) was a pivotal figure in the transition from the Classical to the Romantic era in Western music. Born in Bonn, Germany, Beethoven's extraordinary body of work—encompassing symphonies, concertos, string quartets, piano sonatas, and one opera—displayed a passionate, dramatic, and innovative style that broke with conventions and expanded the musical form. His groundbreaking compositions, such as the Symphony No. 9 with its choral finale 'Ode to Joy,' Symphony No. 5 with its iconic four-note motif, and Piano Sonata No. 14 'Moonlight Sonata,' demonstrated a profound emotional expression and depth, pushing the boundaries of existing forms. Despite his deteriorating hearing in later life, which led to complete deafness, Beethoven continued to compose masterpieces, leaving an indelible mark on the world of music.",

It allowed for a host of never before used support channels to come into existence. For example, emails allowed for cheap and convenient communication irrespective of the location of both business and customer. It also created a written record of queries, making it easier to track and manage than phone calls. We also saw more and more companies start to use instant messaging and live chat. These new channels allowed you to do all of what we mentioned above, but in real-time. We’ve reached the 2000s. And customer support is evolving more and more into what we know it as today. As we discovered in the last section, the internet resulted in channels like email and live chat giving businesses new ways to build meaningful relationships with customers. But with these new channels also arose the need to track and manage data from thousands of customers in one place. Enter: Dedicated customer service software. Specialized customer support software started gradually replacing earlier versions of the helpdesk. These tools provided contact centers with everything from CRM software to cloud-based solutions. The major early players were companies such as Salesforce, Microsoft, and Oracle. Twitter and Facebook weren’t the first social media platforms to come into existence. But they were arguably the first ones that grew large enough to become full-fledged customer support channels. This allowed customers to voice their grievances as well as satisfaction on a public forum through tweets and posts. It also allowed businesses to show the world how they actually take care of and interact with their customers. Today, most major businesses are active (and provide support) on at least one social media channel.",

        "text": "Nora Roberts' Dark Witch: 4 stars. Great world-building, weak romance, but still worth the read I hesitate to describe this book as a 'romance' novel simply because the book spent little time actually exploring the romance between Iona and Boyle. Sure, there IS a romance in this novel. Sprinkled throughout the book are a few scenes where Iona and Boyle meet, chat, wink at each, flirt some more, sleep together, have a misunderstanding, make up, and then profess their undying love. Very formulaic stuff, and all woven around the more important parts of this book The meat of this book is far more focused on the story of the Dark witch and her magically-gifted descendants living in Ireland. Despite being weak on the romance, I really enjoyed it. I think the book is probably better for it, because the romance itself was pretty lackluster stuff Ernest Cline's Ready Player One Video-game players embrace the quest of a lifetime in a virtual world; screenwriter Cline's first novel is old wine in new bottles The real world, in 2045, is the usual dystopian horror story. So who can blame Wade, our narrator, if he spends most of his time in a virtual world? The 18-year-old, orphaned at 11, has no friends in his vertical trailer park in Oklahoma City, while the OASIS has captivating bells and whistles, and it's free. Its creator, the legendary billionaire James Halliday, left a curious will. He had devised an elaborate online game, a hunt for a hidden Easter egg. The finder would inherit his estate. Old-fashioned riddles lead to three keys and three gates. Wade, or rather his avatar Parzival, is the first gunter (egg-hunter) to win the Copper Key, first of three Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers I've heard a lot of great things about Malcolm Gladwell's writing. Friends and co-workers tell me that his subjects are interesting and his writing style is easy to follow without talking down to the reader. I wasn't disappointed with Outliers. In it, Gladwell tackles the subject of success - how people obtain it and what contributes to extraordinary success as opposed to everyday success The thesis - that our success depends much more on circumstances out of our control than any effort we put forth - isn't exactly revolutionary. Most of us know it to be true. However, I don't think I'm lying when I say that most of us also believe that we if we just try that much harder and develop our talent that much further, it will be enough to become wildly successful, despite bad or just mediocre beginnings. Not so, says Gladwell.",

It is considered an F5 on the Fujita Scale, even though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale at the time. It holds records for longest path length at 219 miles (352 km), longest duration at about 3½ hours, and it held the fastest forward speed for a significant tornado at 73 mph (117 km/h) anywhere on Earth until 2021. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history with 695 fatalities.[1] It was also the third most costly tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today. The deadliest tornado in world history was the Daulatpur-Saturia tornado in Bangladesh on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1,300 people.[3] In the history of Bangladesh at least 19 tornadoes killed more than 100 people each, almost half of the total for the rest of the world. For 37 years, the most extensive tornado outbreak on record, in almost every category, was the 1974 Super Outbreak, which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern Ontario in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; 7 were of F5 intensity and 23 were F4. During the peak of this outbreak there were 16 tornadoes on the ground at the same time. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. However, this record was later broken during the 2011 Super Outbreak, which resulted in 360 tornadoes and 324 tornadic fatalities.[4] However, the most tornadoes spawned in the shortest amount of time is 104 over 5 hours and 26 minutes, during the 1981 United Kingdom tornado outbreak on 23 November 1981.",

At 678.9 m (2,227 ft) tall, it is the second-tallest structure and the second-tallest building in the world, behind the Burj Khalifa at 828 m (2,717 ft). The building's name, Merdeka (which literally means 'independence'), is inspired by its proximity to Stadium Merdeka. The spire of the building was completed in October 2021, which marked its final height of 678.9 m (2,227 ft) above ground and 717.6 m (2,354 ft) above sea level. The Burj Khalifa (known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration in 2010) is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is the world's tallest building. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire[2]) of 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure and building in the world since its topping out in 2009, supplanting Taipei 101, the previous holder of that status. The Ping An Finance Center (Chinese: 平安金融中心; pinyin: píng'ān jīnróng zhōngxīn) is a 115-storey, 599.1 m (1,966 ft) supertall skyscraper in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.[7] The building was commissioned by Ping An Insurance and designed by the American architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates. It was completed in 2017,[1] and is the tallest building in Shenzhen, the 2nd tallest building in China and the 5th tallest building in the world.[8][3] It also broke the record of having the highest observation deck in a building at 562 m (1,844 ft).[9] It is the second largest skyscraper in the world by floor area after Azabudai Hills Main Tower in Tokyo, Japan. Tianjin CTF Finance Center is a super-tall skyscraper located in the TEDA CBD of Binhai, Tianjin, China. Construction started in 2013 and was completed in 2019.[1] The tower is the second-tallest building in Municipal Tianjin after Goldin Finance 117, eighth-tallest building in the world, and the tallest building in the world with fewer than 100 floors.[2] It is located in the outer district of the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area. Tianjin CTF Finance Center is designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP in collaboration with Ronald Lu & Partners. The building was honored with the Tall/Slender Structure award at the 2021 Awards Ceremony by the Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE).[3]",

Once cooked, drain the pasta, but make sure to keep a cup of the pasta water aside for later. \n In the meantime, as your pasta is cooking, grab a large skillet and heat the olive oil over medium heat. Toss in the finely chopped garlic and red pepper flakes, and sauté them briefly until the garlic starts to turn golden. Be careful not to burn the garlic. Now, add the prawns to the skillet and cook them until they’re opaque. This should take about 2-3 minutes on each side. \n Once the prawns are cooked, pour in the white wine (if you’re using it), and let it simmer for a couple of minutes to cook off the alcohol.
