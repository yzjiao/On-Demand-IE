For this reason, even if greenhouse gas emissions were stabilized tomorrow, it would take many more years—decades to centuries—for the oceans to adjust to changes in the atmosphere and the climate that have already occurred.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Climate Record\/Study                                                                                                                                                                                            | Greenhouse Gas Emissions | Temperature Variations | Sea Level Changes |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| Greenhouse gases trap more energy from the sun, the oceans are absorbing more heat, resulting in an increase in sea surface temperatures and rising sea level.                                                  | Yes                      | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Changes in ocean temperatures and currents brought about by climate change will lead to alterations in climate patterns around the world.                                                                       | Yes                      | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Warmer waters may promote the development of stronger storms in the tropics, which can cause property damage and loss of life.                                                                                  | Yes                      | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| The impacts associated with sea level rise and stronger storm surges are especially relevant to coastal communities.                                                                                            | Yes                      | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Although the oceans help reduce climate change by storing large amounts of carbon dioxide, increasing levels of dissolved carbon are changing the chemistry of seawater and making it more acidic.              | Yes                      | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Increased ocean acidity makes it more difficult for certain organisms, such as corals and shellfish, to build their skeletons and shells.                                                                       | Yes                      | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| These effects, in turn, could substantially alter the biodiversity and productivity of ocean ecosystems.                                                                                                        | Yes                      | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Changes in ocean systems generally occur over much longer time periods than in the atmosphere, where storms can form and dissipate in a single day.                                                             | Yes                      | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Interactions between the oceans and atmosphere occur slowly over many months to years, and so does the movement of water within the oceans, including the mixing of deep and shallow waters.                    | Yes                      | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Trends can persist for decades, centuries, or longer.                                                                                                                                                           | Yes                      | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Even if greenhouse gas emissions were stabilized tomorrow, it would take many more years—decades to centuries—for the oceans to adjust to changes in the atmosphere and the climate that have already occurred. | Yes                      | Yes                    | Yes               |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Greenhouse Gas Emissions                           | Temperature Changes                  | Sea Level Rise              |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Oceans absorb carbon dioxide                       | Oceans are absorbing more heat       | Rising sea levels           |\n| Increasing levels of dissolved carbon in oceans    | Increase in sea surface temperatures | Stronger storm surges       |\n| Delays in ocean's adjustments to reduced emissions | Alters climate patterns globally     | Affects coastal communities |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Follow instruction but has significant errors","[Header] Partly correct"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1620,"text":"**Instruction**: \nExtract data on greenhouse gas emissions, temperature variations, and sea level changes from these climate records and studies.

Changes in ocean temperatures and currents brought about by climate change will lead to alterations in climate patterns around the world. For example, warmer waters may promote the development of stronger storms in the tropics, which can cause property damage and loss of life. The impacts associated with sea level rise and stronger storm surges are especially relevant to coastal communities.\n\nAlthough the oceans help reduce climate change by storing large amounts of carbon dioxide, increasing levels of dissolved carbon are changing the chemistry of seawater and making it more acidic. Increased ocean acidity makes it more difficult for certain organisms, such as corals and shellfish, to build their skeletons and shells. These effects, in turn, could substantially alter the biodiversity and productivity of ocean ecosystems.\n\nChanges in ocean systems generally occur over much longer time periods than in the atmosphere, where storms can form and dissipate in a single day.

Many English learners represent the newest members of our society (including recently arrived immigrants and children of immigrants) who bring a rich diversity of cultural backgrounds and come from families with rich social and linguistic experiences. They also bring skills in their primary languages that contribute enormously to the state’s economic and social strengths as a talented multilingual and multicultural population.\n\nThis policy explicitly focuses on English learners in the context of the state’s efforts to improve the educational system, the quality of teaching and learning, and educational outcomes. It centers on standards, curriculum frameworks, assessment, accountability\/school improvement, educator quality, early childhood\/preschool, social and family support services, parent\/community involvement, and higher education. Its purpose is to promote local capacity-building and continuous improvement in each of these areas and their interrelationship, based on evidence of effectiveness from local experience as well as the most current rigorous research evidence that speaks to the strengths and needs of the diverse population of English learners.\n\nThe impetus for this policy comes from a number of important related developments in California as well as nationally.

This shift enables the educational system to move beyond remediating students’ English language skills to simultaneously developing their language and literacy skills while engaging in the full range of academic content learning.\n\n\n**Table**: \n|  |\n||\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Key Provisions                                                                                                        | Stakeholders                                               | Impacts                                                                                                                                   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Guidance to local educational agencies (LEAs) for English learners                                                    | California Department of Education, LEAs, English learners | Improved understanding and education of diverse populations                                                                               |\n| Focus on standards, curriculum frameworks, assessment, accountability\/school improvement, and other educational areas | State, educators, schools, parents, communities            | Local capacity-building and continuous improvement                                                                                        |\n| California English Learner Roadmap                                                                                    | English learners, families, schools, communities           | Attainment of college- and career-ready standards and promotion of linguistic diversity                                                   |\n| State Standards, ELD standards, Next Generation Science Standards                                                     | Educators, schools, students, families                     | Academic use of language for all students, student engagement with college- and career-ready curriculum using English and other languages |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Irrelevant or Invalid","[Header] Wrong"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1633,"text":"**Instruction**: \nI give you annual performance evaluations of several employees.

With his trumpet as his companion, Louis breathed life into the city, one note at a time. Born into the vibrant Creole community, he could trace his lineage back to the Big Easy's earliest days. \n Every evening, under the glistening canopy of gas lamps, Louis would play melodies that narrated tales of love and loss, of Mardi Gras and the Mississippi. His music was a stirring potpourri, mirroring the city's unique cultural blend—part French, part African, part Spanish, all American. \n Louis often played on Rue Royale, drawing the crowd in with his captivating Creole songs, passed down through generations. In the distance, a riverboat would hoot its melancholy call, synchronizing with Louis' soulful tune, creating an enchanting symphony of sounds. Patrons in nearby Creole eateries would pause, mid-bite of their jambalaya or crawfish étouffée, captivated by the magic of his music. \n One day, a tourist asked Louis, \"What's your secret?

Overall, no alerts have been triggered, affirming that the farm is maintaining a conducive environment for crop cultivation. \n Based on the sensor logs from XYZFarm001 on July 1, 2023, the soil conditions indicate that the farm is within the optimal range for successful crop growth. The soil moisture level is at 32%, which falls within the desired range of 25-35%. The pH level of 6.8 is also within the recommended range of 6.0-7.0, ensuring the soil's suitability for crop cultivation. The soil temperature stands at 24.5°C, providing favorable conditions for plant development. Additionally, the nutrient levels in the soil are adequate, with nitrogen (N) at 42 ppm, phosphorus (P) at 18 ppm, and potassium (K) at 35 ppm. These values suggest that the soil is well-balanced in terms of essential nutrients, supporting healthy crop growth. Regarding crop growth, the farm is currently cultivating corn (Zea mays) in its vegetative stage (V7). This stage marks the development of the seventh leaf, indicating that the corn plants are actively growing and establishing a strong foundation. The vegetative stage is crucial for plant growth as it focuses on leaf development and the accumulation of energy reserves, which are vital for future reproductive stages and overall yield. With favorable soil conditions, the corn crop at XYZFarm001 is expected to continue thriving and progress through subsequent growth stages.

And there is a significant chance that a recession would make things much worse. In the event of a recession (which Deloitte rates at a 35% probability), the economy would contract, and unemployment would rise. \nInflation has lowered consumers' purchasing power despite gains in nominal income due to the strong labor market. Even though nominal average weekly earnings have increased by 8.3% since December 2020, real earnings have fallen by 5%.8 This will weigh on consumer demand and, hence, retail sales volume. \nConsumer spending9 on services has been picking up steadily as consumers return to bars and restaurants, take vacations, and enjoy sporting events as they did before the pandemic. To some extent, consumers are dipping into their savings to make up for what they missed during 2020-2021. The personal saving rate is now at 3.1%, much lower than pre-pandemic levels. A shift in spending to services will therefore weigh on retail sales at stores selling consumer goods. \n3.The United States’ retail market saw healthy expansion in 2022, with sales volume reaching $102 billion and over 80,000 transactions closing, pushing investors to continue planting capital in this sector. The average annual retail sales volume in the U.S. is $54.3 billion, with a record-high retail sales volume of $111.4 billion in a single year. 2022 saw a near-record high value due to the cost of goods going up, rent increases, and developers expanding. In the third quarter of 2022, $23 billion of retail properties traded hands, which is approximately 4.5 percent higher than the year prior. As inflation continues to rise, landlords are asking more for rents, increasing year-over-year rent costs by 3.9 percent, the fastest increase in one singular year in over a decade. On top of that, average triple net asking rents are sitting at $24 per square foot, a new high. New retail construction is limited which has transitioned to more adaptive reuse occurring in the sector, which a majority of construction being single tenant build-to-suit. Overall, the retail market was healthy in 2022, however the sector is expected to face headwinds in 2023.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Category                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer Purchasing Patterns | Dunkin’ has 3-5% more customers cross shop with Starbucks compared to the opposite.

Yet today, people with albinism still face human rights violations and extreme discrimination. Since 2006, more than 660 attacks on people with albinism in 30 countries have been recorded.\n\n\n\nThe persecution of people with albinism has been identified by the UN as a human rights issue. In countries in Africa, people with albinism are often called zeru zeru, meaning “ghost like creatures.” Too often, they are dehumanized by beliefs that say they are immortal or a curse, and as such, are misunderstood, abandoned, ostracized and sometimes even violently attacked or killed.\n\n\n\nAt more than 170 incidents, Tanzania has the largest recorded number of attacks. But attacks are on the rise in other countries now. Due to myths and superstitions about people with albinism, there is a black market for body parts, hair and skin used by witch doctors in potions and charms. The nature of attacks can range from maiming, to death, to desecrating their graves.\n2.Angolan police shot and killed at least five people in Huambo province on Monday during a taxi drivers’ protest against a recent fuel-price increase. In a statement seen by Human Rights Watch, the Huambo police said “it was not possible to avoid” the killings, as officers tried to contain “acts of violence” by protesters who destroyed properties, confronted the authorities, and used burning tires to block roads.\n\nThe police statement does not explain their use of live bullets against an unarmed crowd. The United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials provides that police use the minimum necessary force at all times. Firearms may only be used to disperse violent assemblies when other less harmful means are not practicable. Law enforcement officers may only intentionally make lethal use of firearms when strictly unavoidable to protect life.\n3.Six women from the Yazidi minority in Iraq were recently rescued with the assistance of the authorities in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and activist Nadia Murad.\n\nThe report says that the women were kidnapped by ISIS in 2014.

So I retrieve some articles that introduce a variety of marine life. Give me the information of name, family, and scientific class of diffrent kinds of marine lives based on these articles.\n\n\n **Text**: \nSea snakes, or coral reef snakes, are elapid snakes that inhabit marine environments for most or all of their lives. They belong to two subfamilies, Hydrophiinae and Laticaudinae. Hydrophiinae also includes Australasian terrestrial snakes, whereas Laticaudinae only includes the sea kraits (Laticauda), of which three species are found exclusively in freshwater. If these three freshwater species are excluded, there are 69 species of sea snakes divided between seven genera. \n Most sea snakes are venomous, except the genus Emydocephalus, which feeds almost exclusively on fish eggs. Sea snakes are extensively adapted to a fully aquatic life and are unable to move on land, except for the sea kraits, which have limited land movement. They are found in warm coastal waters from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and are closely related to venomous terrestrial snakes in Australia.[4] \n Sea turtles (superfamily Chelonioidea), sometimes called marine turtles, are reptiles of the order Testudines and of the suborder Cryptodira. The seven existing species of sea turtles are the flatback, green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and olive ridley sea turtles.[4] All of the seven species listed above, except for the flatback, are present in US waters, and are listed as endangered and\/or threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The flatback itself exists in the waters of Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.[5] Sea turtles can be categorized as hard-shelled (cheloniid) or leathery-shelled (dermochelyid).[6] The only dermochelyid species of sea turtle is the leatherback. \n Pinnipeds (pronounced \/ˈpɪnɪˌpɛdz\/), commonly known as seals,[a] are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous, fin-footed, semiaquatic, mostly marine mammals. They comprise the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the walrus), Otariidae (the eared seals: sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (the earless seals, or true seals). There are 34 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora; their closest living relatives are musteloids (weasels, raccoons, skunks, and red pandas), having diverged about 50 million years ago.\n The Sirenia (\/saɪˈriːni.ə\/ say-REE-nee-ə), commonly referred to as sea cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. The extant Sirenia comprise two distinct families: Dugongidae (the dugong and the now extinct Steller's sea cow) and Trichechidae (manatees, namely the Amazonian manatee, West Indian manatee, and West African manatee) with a total of four species.[2] The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct. Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago (mya). The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene (30–35 mya). \n Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. As an informal and colloquial grouping, they correspond to large members of the infraorder Cetacea, i.e. all cetaceans apart from dolphins and porpoises. Dolphins and porpoises may be considered whales from a formal, cladistic perspective. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest non-cetacean living relatives are the hippopotamuses, from which they and other cetaceans diverged about 54 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have had their last common ancestor around 34 million years ago. Mysticetes include four extant (living) families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale). Odontocetes include the Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales), as well as the six families of dolphins and porpoises which are not considered whales in the informal sense.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Name        | Family       | Scientific Class |\n|-------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Sea snakes  | Hydrophiidae | Snake            |\n| Sea turtles | Chelonioidea | Reptile          |\n| Pinnipeds   | Carnivora    | Mammal           |\n| Sirenia     | Sirenia      | Mammal           |\n| Whales      | Cetacea      | Mammal           |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Name               | Family                          | Scientific Class |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|\n| Sea Snakes         | Testudines, Cryptodira          | N\/A              |\n| Sea Turtles        | Chelonioidea                    | Reptile          |\n| Seals (Pinnipeds)  | Odobenidae, Otariidae, Phocidae | Mammal           |\n| Sea Cows (Sirenia) | Dugongidae, Trichechidae        | Mammal           |\n| Whales             | Mysticeti, Odontoceti           | Mammal           |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Acceptable response with minor imperfection","[Header] Correct"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1662,"text":"**Instruction**: \nMarine life is incredibly diverse and includes a wide variety of species.

Dolphins and porpoises may be considered whales from a formal, cladistic perspective. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest non-cetacean living relatives are the hippopotamuses, from which they and other cetaceans diverged about 54 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have had their last common ancestor around 34 million years ago. Mysticetes include four extant (living) families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale). Odontocetes include the Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales), as well as the six families of dolphins and porpoises which are not considered whales in the informal sense.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Family       |\n|--------------|\n| Hydrophiinae |\n| Chelonioidea |\n| Cetacea      |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Name               | Family                          | Scientific Class |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|\n| Sea Snakes         | Testudines, Cryptodira          | N\/A              |\n| Sea Turtles        | Chelonioidea                    | Reptile          |\n| Seals (Pinnipeds)  | Odobenidae, Otariidae, Phocidae | Mammal           |\n| Sea Cows (Sirenia) | Dugongidae, Trichechidae        | Mammal           |\n| Whales             | Mysticeti, Odontoceti           | Mammal           |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Follow instruction but has significant errors","[Header] Partly correct"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1663,"text":"**Instruction**: \nMarine life is incredibly diverse and includes a wide variety of species.

They belong to two subfamilies, Hydrophiinae and Laticaudinae. Hydrophiinae also includes Australasian terrestrial snakes, whereas Laticaudinae only includes the sea kraits (Laticauda), of which three species are found exclusively in freshwater. If these three freshwater species are excluded, there are 69 species of sea snakes divided between seven genera. \n Most sea snakes are venomous, except the genus Emydocephalus, which feeds almost exclusively on fish eggs. Sea snakes are extensively adapted to a fully aquatic life and are unable to move on land, except for the sea kraits, which have limited land movement. They are found in warm coastal waters from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and are closely related to venomous terrestrial snakes in Australia.[4] \n Sea turtles (superfamily Chelonioidea), sometimes called marine turtles, are reptiles of the order Testudines and of the suborder Cryptodira. The seven existing species of sea turtles are the flatback, green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and olive ridley sea turtles.[4] All of the seven species listed above, except for the flatback, are present in US waters, and are listed as endangered and\/or threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The flatback itself exists in the waters of Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.[5] Sea turtles can be categorized as hard-shelled (cheloniid) or leathery-shelled (dermochelyid).[6] The only dermochelyid species of sea turtle is the leatherback. \n Pinnipeds (pronounced \/ˈpɪnɪˌpɛdz\/), commonly known as seals,[a] are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous, fin-footed, semiaquatic, mostly marine mammals. They comprise the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the walrus), Otariidae (the eared seals: sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (the earless seals, or true seals). There are 34 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora; their closest living relatives are musteloids (weasels, raccoons, skunks, and red pandas), having diverged about 50 million years ago.\n The Sirenia (\/saɪˈriːni.ə\/ say-REE-nee-ə), commonly referred to as sea cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. The extant Sirenia comprise two distinct families: Dugongidae (the dugong and the now extinct Steller's sea cow) and Trichechidae (manatees, namely the Amazonian manatee, West Indian manatee, and West African manatee) with a total of four species.[2] The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct. Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago (mya).

It also investigates the solar sources at SCs 23 and 24. The Disturbed storm time (Dst) and Sunspot Number (SSN) data were used in the study. The study establishes that the magnitude of the rate of occurrences of geomagnetic storms is higher (lower) at the descending phases (minimum phases) of the solar cycle. It as well reveals that severe and extreme geomagnetic storms (Dst < -250 nT) seldom occur at low solar activity but at very high solar activity and are mostly associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) when occurred. Storms caused by CME + CH-HSSW are more prominent during the descending phase than any other phase of the solar cycle. Solar minimum features more CH-HSSW- associated storms than any other phase. It was also revealed that all high intensity geomagnetic storms (strong, severe and extreme) are mostly associated with CMEs. However, CH-HSSW can occasionally generate strong storms during solar minimum. The results have proven that CMEs are the leading cause of geomagnetic storms at the ascending, maximum and the descending phases of the cycles 23 and 24 followed by CME + CH-HSSW. The results from this study indicate that the rate of occurrence of geomagnetic storms could be predicted in SC phases.\n2.The variations of ionospheric Total electron content (TEC) due to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and geomagnetic storms over New Zealand were studied. TEC data were collected from dual-frequency GPS sites operated by the University NAVSTAR Consortium in New Zealand, at Ous2 (−45.86°N, 170.51°E), Dund (−45.89°N, 170.59°E), Mtjo (−43.99°N, 170.46°E), and Quar (−43.53°N, 169.81°E) stations. The findings of this study show that the variability of ionospheric TEC was more noticeable during the main phase of the storm on September 08, 2017 than the initial phase on September 07, 2017, recovery phase on September 09, 2017, and during the CME day on September 06, 2017. Also, the enhancements of change in TEC (\nTEC) were pronounced more over the Mtjo station during the CME day and over the Quar station during the geomagnetic storm day than over other stations. On September 06, 2017, two X-class solar flares, specifically X2.2 and X9.3, were observed with quiet geomagnetic storm conditions throughout the CME day, resulting in an increase in TEC. On September 07, 2017, the M7.3, X1.3, and on September 08, 2017, the X8.1 solar flare classes with disturbed geomagnetic conditions led to a significant enhancement of TEC over the stations at 02:00 UT (13:00 LT).\n3.The effects of solar flares on ionospheric total electron content (TEC) over Iceland before and during the geomagnetic storm of September 8, 2017 were studied. Global Positioning Syste (GPS)-TEC data were obtained from dual-frequency GPS sites operated by the University NAVSTAR Consortium at Dyna (65.06°N, −16.6°E) and Kisa (64.7°N, −17.6°E) stations. The findings of this study show that the enhancement of ionospheric TEC was more noticeable over the Kisa station than over the Dyna station during the coronal mass ejection day. However, during the geomagnetic storm day, maximum enhancement of TEC was observed over the Dyna station than over the Kisa station. The values of the ionospheric TEC during the initial phase of the storm were greater than during the main and recovery phases of the storm over both stations. This might be due to the effects of X-class solar flares and shock wave preceding the arriving of interplanetary coronal mass ejections plasma.\n\n\n**Table**: \nTable: Abbreviations and Full Names\n| Abbreviation | Full Name  |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| TEC | Total electron content (TEC) |\n| Dyna | Dyni (65.06°N, 16.6°E) |\n| Kisa | Kisa (64.7°N, 17.6°E) |\n| Ous2 | Ous2 (−45.86°N, 170.51°E) |\n| Dund | Dund (−45.89°N, 170.59°E) |\n| Mtjo | Mtjo (−43.99°N, 170.46°E) |\n| Quar | Quar (−43.53°N, 169.81°E) |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Abbreviation | Full Name                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------|\n| SCs          | Solar Cycles              |\n| Dst          | Disturbed Storm Time      |\n| SSN          | Sunspot Number            |\n| CMEs         | Coronal Mass Ejections    |\n| CH-HSSW      | N\/A                       |\n| TEC          | Total Electron Content    |\n| GPS          | Global Positioning System |\n| UT           | N\/A                       |\n| LT           | N\/A                       |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Follow instruction but has significant errors","[Header] Correct"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1682,"text":"**Instruction**: \nExtract all abbreviations and corresponding full names in the text into a table.\n\n\n **Text**: \n1.This study examines the occurrences rate of geomagnetic storms during the solar cycles (SCs) 20–24.

This might be due to the effects of X-class solar flares and shock wave preceding the arriving of interplanetary coronal mass ejections plasma.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Abbreviation | Full Name                          |\n|--------------|------------------------------------|\n| SC           | Solar Cycle                        |\n| Dst          | Disturbed Storm Time               |\n| SSN          | Sunspot Number                     |\n| CH-HSSW      | Coronal Hole - High Speed Streamer |\n| CME          | Coronal Mass Ejection              |\n| GPS          | Global Positioning System          |\n| TEC          | Total Electron Content             |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Abbreviation | Full Name                 |\n|--------------|---------------------------|\n| SCs          | Solar Cycles              |\n| Dst          | Disturbed Storm Time      |\n| SSN          | Sunspot Number            |\n| CMEs         | Coronal Mass Ejections    |\n| CH-HSSW      | N\/A                       |\n| TEC          | Total Electron Content    |\n| GPS          | Global Positioning System |\n| UT           | N\/A                       |\n| LT           | N\/A                       |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Correct and satisfying","[Header] Correct"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1685,"text":"**Instruction**: \nI'm trying to figure out what customers think about this new gadget.

The most alarming scientific predictions say that the glaciers will disappear completely by 2050 if the earth’s temperature continues to increase at its current rate. Analysis shows that the ice above 3,800 metres on the Mont Blanc massif is relatively stable, but below that it’s retracting quite quickly. The Brenva glacier on the Italian side loses around 12m of ice per year, while the Mer de Glace in Chamonix loses 4 to 5m per year on average and is now considerably thinner in depth as well. \n Mount Kilimanjaro is famous for the snowy cap on its Kibo summit, but approximately 85 per cent of the glacial ice on Mount Kilimanjaro disappeared between 1912 and 2011 according to a report by NASA. The glaciers, thought to be 10,000 years old, lost more than 4,000,000 cubic meters of ice in the past 13 years and predictions say the cap will have completely disappeared by 2033. \n A third of the famous Great Wall of China has disappeared due to a combination of natural erosion, brick theft to build houses and tourist damage. Construction on the wall first began in the 3rd century BC, but nearly 6,300km was built during the Ming era between 1368 and 1644. Some of the construction has simply weathered away, while plants growing in the walls have accelerated the decay. Chinese authorities have also had issues with tourists etching graffiti on the stone structure.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Destination         | Historical Context                            | Conservation Status |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Taj Mahal           | 400 years old                                 | Struggling          |\n| Machu Picchu        | Declared a Unesco World Heritage site in 1983 | Struggling          |\n| Machu Picchu        | Altitude sickness                             | Struggling          |\n| Machu Picchu        | Deforestation                                 | Struggling          |\n| Machu Picchu        | Landslides                                    | Struggling          |\n| Machu Picchu        | Urban development                             | Struggling          |\n| Mont Blanc          | 3,800 metres                                  | Retreating          |\n| Brenva glacier      | 3,800 metres                                  | Retreating          |\n| Mer de Glace        | 3,800 metres                                  | Retreating          |\n| Mount Kilimanjaro   | 5,895 metres                                  | Disappearing        |\n| Great Wall of China | 3rd century BC                                | Disappearing        |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Cultural Heritage Site | Historical Context                         | Conservation Status                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Taj Mahal              | Almost 400 years old                       | Struggling with age, losing its sheen due to acid rain and air pollution, wooden foundations straining due to polluted Yamuna River nearby |\n| Machu Picchu           | Unesco World Heritage site since 1983      | Damage caused by tourist volume, deforestation, risk of landslides, uncontrolled urban development, and earthquake risk                    |\n| French Alps Glaciers   | N\/A                                        | Retreating due to global warming, predicted to disappear completely by 2050 if current temperature increase continues                      |\n| Mount Kilimanjaro      | Glacial ice approximately 10,000 years old | Lost 85% of its glacier between 1912 and 2011, predicted to disappear completely by 2033                                                   |\n| Great Wall of China    | Construction began in 3rd century BC       | A third of the wall has disappeared due to erosion, brick theft, and tourist damage                                                        |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Follow instruction but has significant errors","[Header] Correct"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1690,"text":"**Instruction**: \nExtract a table summarizing the information about cultural heritage sites, their historical context, and conservation status based on the background context.\n\n\n **Text**: \nPlenty of the must-see attractions we take for granted might not be around forever.

The Brenva glacier on the Italian side loses around 12m of ice per year, while the Mer de Glace in Chamonix loses 4 to 5m per year on average and is now considerably thinner in depth as well. \n Mount Kilimanjaro is famous for the snowy cap on its Kibo summit, but approximately 85 per cent of the glacial ice on Mount Kilimanjaro disappeared between 1912 and 2011 according to a report by NASA. The glaciers, thought to be 10,000 years old, lost more than 4,000,000 cubic meters of ice in the past 13 years and predictions say the cap will have completely disappeared by 2033. \n A third of the famous Great Wall of China has disappeared due to a combination of natural erosion, brick theft to build houses and tourist damage. Construction on the wall first began in the 3rd century BC, but nearly 6,300km was built during the Ming era between 1368 and 1644. Some of the construction has simply weathered away, while plants growing in the walls have accelerated the decay. Chinese authorities have also had issues with tourists etching graffiti on the stone structure.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Cultural Heritage Site | Historical Context                         | Conservation Status                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Taj Mahal              | Almost 400 years old                       | Struggling with age, losing its sheen due to acid rain and air pollution, wooden foundations straining due to polluted Yamuna River nearby |\n| Machu Picchu           | Unesco World Heritage site since 1983      | Damage caused by tourist volume, deforestation, risk of landslides, uncontrolled urban development, and earthquake risk                    |\n| French Alps Glaciers   | N\/A                                        | Retreating due to global warming, predicted to disappear completely by 2050 if current temperature increase continues                      |\n| Mount Kilimanjaro      | Glacial ice approximately 10,000 years old | Lost 85% of its glacier between 1912 and 2011, predicted to disappear completely by 2033                                                   |\n| Great Wall of China    | Construction began in 3rd century BC       | A third of the wall has disappeared due to erosion, brick theft, and tourist damage                                                        |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Cultural Heritage Site | Historical Context                         | Conservation Status                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Taj Mahal              | Almost 400 years old                       | Struggling with age, losing its sheen due to acid rain and air pollution, wooden foundations straining due to polluted Yamuna River nearby |\n| Machu Picchu           | Unesco World Heritage site since 1983      | Damage caused by tourist volume, deforestation, risk of landslides, uncontrolled urban development, and earthquake risk                    |\n| French Alps Glaciers   | N\/A                                        | Retreating due to global warming, predicted to disappear completely by 2050 if current temperature increase continues                      |\n| Mount Kilimanjaro      | Glacial ice approximately 10,000 years old | Lost 85% of its glacier between 1912 and 2011, predicted to disappear completely by 2033                                                   |\n| Great Wall of China    | Construction began in 3rd century BC       | A third of the wall has disappeared due to erosion, brick theft, and tourist damage                                                        |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Correct and satisfying","[Header] Correct"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1691,"text":"**Instruction**: \nExtract a table summarizing the information about cultural heritage sites, their historical context, and conservation status based on the background context.\n\n\n **Text**: \nPlenty of the must-see attractions we take for granted might not be around forever.

The queries are compared against the keys, and the values corresponding to the matching keys are returned as the output.\n\nWhen the order of the queries is changed, the model may prioritize different keys, which can result in different values being retrieved. For example, if the first query matches a key with a low relevance score and the second query matches a key with a high relevance score, permuting the queries would change the order in which the keys are considered and could lead to a different output.\n\nAdditionally, if the key-value pairs are not unique, permuting the order of the queries may also affect the output. For example, if there are multiple keys that match the same query, the order in which they are considered can affect which value is returned.\n\nOverall, permuting the order of the queries can have a significant impact on the output of the key-value-query model, and it is important to consider the order carefully to ensure that the desired values are retrieved.\n\nWhat rationale is used to motivate the use of attention mechanisms (select all that apply)?\n\n\nWhat rationale is used to motivate the use of attention mechanisms (select all that apply)?\n\n\nWe want to remove the bottleneck of having a fixed, limited-capacity initial decoder state\n\n\nWithout attention mechanisms, the model will be more likely to take into account only the final few words\n\n\nEasier to compute in parallel\n\n\nMany seq2seq tasks like machine translation rely on alignment\nChatGPT\nThe rationales used to motivate the use of attention mechanisms are:\n\nWe want to remove the bottleneck of having a fixed, limited-capacity initial decoder state\nWithout attention mechanisms, the model will be more likely to take into account only the final few words\nMany seq2seq tasks like machine translation rely on alignment\nAttention mechanisms help to address the limitations of traditional sequence-to-sequence models, where the decoder state is fixed and has limited capacity to capture all relevant information from the input sequence. Attention mechanisms allow the decoder to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence, based on their relevance to the current output, and dynamically adjust the decoder state accordingly. This allows the model to handle longer sequences and capture more nuanced relationships between input and output.\n\nWithout attention mechanisms, the model may be more likely to rely on only the final few words of the input sequence, as they are the most recent and have the strongest influence on the final decoder state. Attention mechanisms allow the model to consider all parts of the input sequence, weighted by their relevance to the current output, and produce more accurate and nuanced predictions.\n\nFurthermore, many sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation, rely on aligning the input and output sequences to capture the correct correspondence between words or phrases. Attention mechanisms provide a natural way to incorporate alignment information into the model, allowing it to attend to the relevant parts of the input sequence while generating the output sequence.\n\nFinally, while attention mechanisms can be more computationally expensive than traditional models, they can be computed in parallel and are well-suited to modern hardware, making them scalable and efficient for large-scale applications.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Intent                                         | Entities                                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Understand the impact of permuting query order | key-value-query model, output, relevance of values                                                                                              |\n| Motivate the use of attention mechanisms       | remove bottleneck, limited-capacity initial decoder state, final few words, seq2seq tasks, machine translation, alignment, parallel computation |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Intents                                      | Entities                   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Enhance chatbot comprehension                | Key-value-query model      |\n| Improve chatbot responses                    | Attention mechanisms       |\n| Understand the impact of permuting queries   | Decoder state              |\n| Learn the rationale for attention mechanisms | Sequence-to-sequence tasks |\n| Determine benefits of attention mechanisms   | Alignment                  |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Acceptable response with minor imperfection","[Header] Correct"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1714,"text":"**Instruction**: \nHey, I’m tinkering with a chatbot and trying to make it smarter.

Attention mechanisms provide a natural way to incorporate alignment information into the model, allowing it to attend to the relevant parts of the input sequence while generating the output sequence.\n\nFinally, while attention mechanisms can be more computationally expensive than traditional models, they can be computed in parallel and are well-suited to modern hardware, making them scalable and efficient for large-scale applications.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| We want to remove the bottleneck of having a fixed, limited-capacity initial decoder state                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Without attention mechanisms, the model will be more likely to take into account only the final few words                                                                                                                                    |\n| Many seq2seq tasks like machine translation rely on alignment                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Attention mechanisms help to address the limitations of traditional sequence-to-sequence models, where the decoder state is fixed and has limited capacity to capture all relevant information from the input sequence.                      |\n| Attention mechanisms allow the decoder to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence, based on their relevance to the current output, and dynamically adjust the decoder state accordingly.                                  |\n| This allows the model to handle longer sequences and capture more nuanced relationships between input and output.                                                                                                                            |\n| Without attention mechanisms, the model may be more likely to rely on only the final few words of the input sequence, as they are the most recent and have the strongest influence on the final decoder state.                               |\n| Attention mechanisms allow the model to consider all parts of the input sequence, weighted by their relevance to the current output, and produce more accurate and nuanced predictions.                                                      |\n| Furthermore, many sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation, rely on aligning the input and output sequences to capture the correct correspondence between words or phrases.                                                   |\n| Attention mechanisms provide a natural way to incorporate alignment information into the model, allowing it to attend to the relevant parts of the input sequence while generating the output sequence.                                      |\n| Finally, while attention mechanisms can be more computationally expensive than traditional models, they can be computed in parallel and are well-suited to modern hardware, making them scalable and efficient for large-scale applications. |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Intents                                      | Entities                   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Enhance chatbot comprehension                | Key-value-query model      |\n| Improve chatbot responses                    | Attention mechanisms       |\n| Understand the impact of permuting queries   | Decoder state              |\n| Learn the rationale for attention mechanisms | Sequence-to-sequence tasks |\n| Determine benefits of attention mechanisms   | Alignment                  |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Follow instruction but has significant errors","[Header] Wrong"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1717,"text":"**Instruction**: \nExtract the date of founding, location, and the representative directions in computer science for each university.

With new trends and ideas, fashion has an eye towards the future. The fashion industry will see huge amounts of innovation in coming years as new technology and changing customer trends and demands will transform the industry \n Here are three changes to expect in the future of fashion:  \n 1 . Data-Driven \n It used to be that consumers wore whatever designers created. Those days are over, and fashion brands now use data to understand customer preferences, monitor their shopping behavior and create products that meet their needs. The future of fashion is data-driven: by leveraging data on consumer trends, brands can create pieces consumers are most likely to purchase. Many stores and brands, including Miu Miu and Stitch Fix, use data to predict the rise and fall of trends. Predictive analytics consider everything from climate to color preferences, social media trends and political movements. The benefits of using data in fashion are numerous: from only producing pieces consumers will actually wear to reducing waste and connecting the right consumers with pieces they will enjoy. Data also helps brands run more efficiently, giving them room to innovate and balance supply and demand. 2 . Sustainable \n Fashion has long been one of the biggest contributors to waste and climate change, largely because of its unsustainable and non-eco-friendly production methods. But the tides are changing, and brands are moving towards more sustainable fabrics and manufacturing methods. Research shows that 88% of consumers want brands to help them be more environmentally friendly. Even with its strides, fashion has a long way to go. Fashion production releases 10% of the world’s carbon emissions, more than international flights and maritime shipping combined. A number of sustainable fashion brands are growing, and their innovative practices are becoming more commonplace among retailers. British design company Vin + Omi harvests its own crops to make clothing from horseradish plants and chestnuts. It also features clothing items made from recycled paint containers. Levi’s recently unveiled a new collection of denim that uses 96% less water to create—a major win for clothing that notoriously requires a lot of water to produce.  \n 3 . Digital \n The future of fashion is happening online, and brands will have to adjust how they create and sell clothing to make it work in a digital world.  \n With more shoppers taking advantage of online shopping, fashion retailers have to follow suit. Aside from changing Covid-19 restrictions, consumers increasingly prefer the convenience and speed of online shopping, even if it means not being able to try an item on in person. The most successful fashion brands of the future won’t just make their clothing available online—they will also create an immersive digital shopping experience with things like virtual fit or sizing tools, virtual showrooms and virtual stylists. Fashion brands will also leverage technology like AR and VR to allow consumers to “try on” items digitally from the comfort of their own homes. Major retailers like Adidas, Macy’s and Modcloth are adopting virtual dressing rooms and bringing the technology mainstream.

Data-Driven \n It used to be that consumers wore whatever designers created. Those days are over, and fashion brands now use data to understand customer preferences, monitor their shopping behavior and create products that meet their needs. The future of fashion is data-driven: by leveraging data on consumer trends, brands can create pieces consumers are most likely to purchase. Many stores and brands, including Miu Miu and Stitch Fix, use data to predict the rise and fall of trends. Predictive analytics consider everything from climate to color preferences, social media trends and political movements. The benefits of using data in fashion are numerous: from only producing pieces consumers will actually wear to reducing waste and connecting the right consumers with pieces they will enjoy. Data also helps brands run more efficiently, giving them room to innovate and balance supply and demand. 2 . Sustainable \n Fashion has long been one of the biggest contributors to waste and climate change, largely because of its unsustainable and non-eco-friendly production methods.

Research shows that 88% of consumers want brands to help them be more environmentally friendly. Even with its strides, fashion has a long way to go.

Aside from changing Covid-19 restrictions, consumers increasingly prefer the convenience and speed of online shopping, even if it means not being able to try an item on in person.

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society.[2][3] Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian state in the novel on Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany.[2][3][4] More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within societies and the ways in which they can be manipulated.\n\nThe story takes place in an imagined future in the year 1984, when much of the world is in perpetual war. Great Britain, now known as Airstrip One, has become a province of the totalitarian superstate Oceania, which is led by Big Brother, a dictatorial leader supported by an intense cult of personality manufactured by the Party's Thought Police. Through the Ministry of Truth, the Party engages in omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and constant propaganda to persecute individuality and independent thinking.[5]\n\nThe protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent mid-level worker at the Ministry of Truth who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. Smith keeps a forbidden diary. He begins a relationship with a colleague, Julia and they learn about a shadowy resistance group called the Brotherhood. However, their contact within the Brotherhood turns out to be a Party agent, and Smith is arrested. He is subjected to months of psychological manipulation and torture by the Ministry of Love and is released once he has come to love Big Brother.\n2.To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by the American author Harper Lee. It was published in 1960 and was instantly successful. In the United States, it is widely read in high schools and middle schools. To Kill a Mockingbird has become a classic of modern American literature; a year after its release, it won the Pulitzer Prize. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was ten.\n\nDespite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality, the novel is renowned for its warmth and humor. Atticus Finch, the narrator's father, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. The historian Joseph Crespino explains, 'In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its main character, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism.'[1] As a Southern Gothic novel and Bildungsroman, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the Deep South. Lessons from the book emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice.[2] Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets. In 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one 'every adult should read before they die'.[3]\n\nReaction to the novel varied widely upon publication. Despite the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education, literary analysis of it is sparse. Author Mary McDonough Murphy, who collected individual impressions of To Kill a Mockingbird by several authors and public figures, calls the book 'an astonishing phenomenon'.[4] It was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan, with a screenplay by Horton Foote. Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's hometown.\n3.Emma is a novel written by Jane Austen. It is set in the fictional country village of Highbury and the surrounding estates of Hartfield, Randalls and Donwell Abbey, and involves the relationships among people from a small number of families.[2] The novel was first published in December 1815, with its title page listing a publication date of 1816. As in her other novels, Austen explores the concerns and difficulties of genteel women living in Georgian–Regency England. Emma is a comedy of manners.\n\nBefore she began the novel, Austen wrote, 'I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.'[3] In the first sentence, she introduces the title character as 'Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and a happy disposition... had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.'[4] Emma is spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people's lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray.\n\nEmma, written after Austen's move to Chawton, was her last novel to be published during her lifetime,[5] while Persuasion, the last complete novel Austen wrote, was published posthumously.\n\nThe novel has been adapted for a number of films, television programmes and stage plays.\n\n\n**Table**: \n|  |\n||\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Title                 | Themes                                      | Characters                        | Stylistic Features                    |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Nineteen Eighty-Four  | Totalitarianism, mass surveillance, truth   | Winston Smith, Julia, Big Brother | Dystopian, cautionary tale, political |\n| To Kill a Mockingbird | Racial injustice, innocence, prejudice      | Atticus Finch, Scout, Boo Radley  | Southern Gothic, Bildungsroman        |\n| Emma                  | Relationships, social class, self-discovery | Emma Woodhouse                    | Comedy of manners, Georgian–Regency   |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Irrelevant or Invalid","[Header] Wrong"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1754,"text":"**Instruction**: \nFind title, themes, characters, and stylistic features through the analysis of literary texts.\n\n\n **Text**: \n1.Nineteen Eighty-Four (also published as 1984) is a dystopian social science fiction novel and cautionary tale by English writer George Orwell.

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society.[2][3] Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian state in the novel on Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany.[2][3][4] More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within societies and the ways in which they can be manipulated.\n\nThe story takes place in an imagined future in the year 1984, when much of the world is in perpetual war. Great Britain, now known as Airstrip One, has become a province of the totalitarian superstate Oceania, which is led by Big Brother, a dictatorial leader supported by an intense cult of personality manufactured by the Party's Thought Police. Through the Ministry of Truth, the Party engages in omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and constant propaganda to persecute individuality and independent thinking.[5]\n\nThe protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent mid-level worker at the Ministry of Truth who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. Smith keeps a forbidden diary. He begins a relationship with a colleague, Julia and they learn about a shadowy resistance group called the Brotherhood. However, their contact within the Brotherhood turns out to be a Party agent, and Smith is arrested. He is subjected to months of psychological manipulation and torture by the Ministry of Love and is released once he has come to love Big Brother.\n2.To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by the American author Harper Lee. It was published in 1960 and was instantly successful. In the United States, it is widely read in high schools and middle schools. To Kill a Mockingbird has become a classic of modern American literature; a year after its release, it won the Pulitzer Prize. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was ten.\n\nDespite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality, the novel is renowned for its warmth and humor. Atticus Finch, the narrator's father, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. The historian Joseph Crespino explains, 'In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its main character, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism.'[1] As a Southern Gothic novel and Bildungsroman, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the Deep South. Lessons from the book emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice.[2] Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets. In 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one 'every adult should read before they die'.[3]\n\nReaction to the novel varied widely upon publication. Despite the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education, literary analysis of it is sparse. Author Mary McDonough Murphy, who collected individual impressions of To Kill a Mockingbird by several authors and public figures, calls the book 'an astonishing phenomenon'.[4] It was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan, with a screenplay by Horton Foote. Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's hometown.\n3.Emma is a novel written by Jane Austen. It is set in the fictional country village of Highbury and the surrounding estates of Hartfield, Randalls and Donwell Abbey, and involves the relationships among people from a small number of families.[2] The novel was first published in December 1815, with its title page listing a publication date of 1816.

On average, John consumed 1,800 calories per day, slightly below his daily calorie goal of 2,000. However, he maintained a 90% compliance rate with his calorie target, indicating overall adherence to his dietary plan.\n\nIn terms of macronutrient distribution, John's diet consisted of 45% carbohydrates, 30% proteins, and 25% fats. This balanced distribution suggests a well-rounded approach to nutrition, ensuring an adequate intake of essential nutrients.\n\nJohn followed a consistent meal pattern, with three meals per day at set times: breakfast at 8:00 AM, lunch at 1:00 PM, and dinner at 7:00 PM. He also incorporated occasional snacks between meals, typically opting for fruits and nuts as healthier alternatives.\n\nAnalyzing John's food choices, several items stood out as his favorites. These included chicken breast, brown rice, mixed vegetables, spinach, and bananas, which were frequently consumed during the tracking period. John demonstrated a moderate level of variety, with 80% of the food items being unique.\n\nTo further improve his nutritional intake, it is recommended that John diversifies his food choices and incorporates more nutrient-dense options. Adding foods like quinoa, salmon, kale, and almonds can enhance his overall nutrient profile and provide a wider range of essential vitamins and minerals.\n\nOverall, John is progressing well towards his calorie intake goal, but there is room for improvement in terms of food variety.

This information is essential for smart city management and planning.\n\n\n **Text**: \nIf you live in a more developed urban region, think of the number of smart devices (your phone and so on) and sensors in your home or workplace. Then expand that to include all the smart tech used by every person, home, building, infrastructure, resource, and service in your street, neighbourhood, and city. There are now billions of IoT devices around the world. Each moment of the day and night, these technologies receive, record, and transmit an unthinkable amount of information, much of which is available to users straight away. The individual is now connected to every other facet of society, such as corporations and government, like never before in history. If harnessed wisely, these smart devices and services can drastically improve residents’ quality of life.\n\nThis leads to the second component of a high-functioning smart city. This other crucial part revolves around governments effectively monitoring, using, and responding to this sea of data and user feedback to boost liveability and resource efficiency for citizens. So, a successful smart city relies not only on the installation of these systems but also on the efforts of administrative and corporate bodies to use them for the public good. The adoption of these strategies and tools is only a means to an end – to better serve the community.\n\nAs a 2018 McKinsey Global Institute report reminds us, the point of becoming a smart city is to “respond more effectively and dynamically to the needs and desires of residents … to optimize the infrastructure, resources, and spaces they share.” The authors also comment that “Asian megacities, with their young populations of digital natives and big urban problems to solve” are rapidly transforming thanks to their “exceptionally high adoption” of smart tech.\n\nThey identify eight key domains where smart cities are making great strides. These broad areas are listed below, with some smart technology examples as taken from the report.\n\nMobility: Real-time public transport updates, smart parking, demand-based microtransit, e-hailing, congestion pricing, predictive maintenance of transportation infrastructure, and real-time road navigations.\nSecurity: Smart surveillance, home security systems, crowd management, emergency response optimisation, real-time crime mapping, and data-driven building inspections.\nHealthcare: Data-based public health interventions (such as sanitisation and child care), infectious disease surveillance, telemedicine, and remote patient monitoring.\nEnergy: Dynamic electricity pricing, smart streetlights, home energy automation systems, and distribution automation systems.\nWater: Water quality monitoring, water consumption tracking, and smart irrigation.\nWaste: Optimisation of waste collection systems, and digital tracking and payment of waste disposal.\nEconomic Development and Housing: Digital land-use and building permitting, business licensing, personalised education, digital business tax filing, and peer-to-peer accommodation platforms.\nEngagement and Community: Digital citizen services, local civic engagement applications, and local connection platforms.\nThe widespread implementation of smart devices enables governing authorities and citizens to collaborate and exchange data in innovative, progressive ways. In the future, we are likely to see more such services and systems integrated into urban development plans.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Domain                           | Smart Technologies

The victory was made possible by the defection of Mir Jafar, who was Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah's commander in chief. The battle helped the British East India Company take control of Bengal. Over the next hundred years, they seized control of most of the rest of the Indian subcontinent, including Burma. \n The battle took place at Palashi (Anglicised version: Plassey) on the banks of the Hooghly River, about 150 kilometres (93 mi) north of Calcutta (now Kolkata) and south of Murshidabad in West Bengal, then capital of Bengal Subah. The belligerents were the British East India Company, and the Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal. He succeeded Alivardi Khan (his maternal grandfather). Siraj-ud-Daulah had become the Nawab of Bengal the year before, and he had ordered the English to stop the extension of their fortification. Robert Clive bribed Mir Jafar, the commander-in-chief of the Nawab's army, and also promised to make him Nawab of Bengal. Clive defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah at Plassey in 1757 and captured Calcutta.[2]\n The War of the Spanish Succession was a European great power conflict that took place from 1701 to 1715. The death of childless Charles II of Spain in November 1700 led to a struggle for control of the Spanish Empire between his heirs, Philip of Anjou and Charles of Austria, and their respective supporters, among them Spain, Austria, France, the Dutch Republic, Savoy and Great Britain. Related conflicts include the 1700–1721 Great Northern War, Rákóczi's War of Independence in Hungary, the Camisards revolt in southern France, Queen Anne's War in North America and minor trade wars in India and South America. \n Although weakened by over a century of continuous conflict, Spain remained a global power whose territories included the Spanish Netherlands, large parts of Italy, the Philippines, and much of the Americas, which meant its acquisition by either France or Austria potentially threatened the European balance of power. Attempts by Louis XIV of France and William III of England to resolve the issue through diplomacy were rejected by the Spanish and Charles II named Louis' grandson, Philip of Anjou, as his heir. His proclamation as king of an undivided Spanish Empire on 16 November 1700 led to war, with France and Spain on one side and the Grand Alliance on the other. The First Javanese War of Succession was a struggle between Sultan Amangkurat III of Mataram and the Dutch East India Company who supported the claim of the Sultan's uncle, Pangeran Puger to the throne. \n Amangkurat II died in 1703 and was briefly succeeded by his son, Amangkurat III. The Dutch believed they had found a more reliable client in his uncle Pangeran Puger. Tensions increased when Amangkurat was accused of giving refuge to the rebel Surapati.[4] Pangeran Puger accused Amangkurat before the Dutch of planning an uprising in East Java. Unlike Pangeran Puger, Amangkurat III inherited blood connection with Surabayan ruler, Jangrana II, from Amangkurat II and this lent credibility to the allegation that he cooperated with the now powerful Untung Surapati in Pasuruan. Panembahan Cakraningrat II of Madura, VOC’s most trusted ally, persuaded the Dutch to support Pangeran Puger. Pangeran Puger took the title of Pakubuwana I upon his accession in June 1704.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Event Name                           | Date         | Participants                                                                   | Location          | Outcome                                                                                                  |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The Battle of Plassey                | 23 June 1757 | British East India Company, Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah                              | Palashi (Plassey) | The British East India Company took control of Bengal                                                    |\n| The War of the Spanish Succession    | 1701-1715    | Spain, Austria, France, the Dutch Republic, Savoy, Great Britain               | Europe            | The War of the Spanish Succession was a European great power conflict that took place from 1701 to 1715. |\n| The First Javanese War of Succession | 1703         | Sultan Amangkurat III of Mataram, Pangeran Puger, the Dutch East India Company | Java              | The Dutch East India Company supported the claim of the Sultan's uncle, Pangeran Puger to the throne.    |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Event                            | Date         | Participants                                                               | Location                  | Outcome                                         |\n|----------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Battle of Plassey                | 23 June 1757 | British East India Company, Nawab of Bengal, French allies                 | Palashi (Plassey), Bengal | British victory, control of Bengal              |\n| War of the Spanish Succession    | 1701-1715    | Spain, Austria, France, Dutch Republic, Savoy, Great Britain               | Europe, Spanish Empire    | Conflict over Spanish Empire, complex outcome   |\n| First Javanese War of Succession | 1703-1704    | Sultan Amangkurat III of Mataram, Dutch East India Company, Pangeran Puger | Java, Dutch East Indies   | Struggle for Javanese throne, Dutch involvement |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Correct and satisfying","[Header] Correct"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1810,"text":"**Instruction**: \nThe texts are mainly about three historical events.

Extract the details about these events into a table, including event name, date, participants, location, outcome.\n\n\n **Text**: \nThe Battle of Plassey was a decisive victory of the British East India Company over the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies on 23 June 1757, under the leadership of Robert Clive. The victory was made possible by the defection of Mir Jafar, who was Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah's commander in chief. The battle helped the British East India Company take control of Bengal. Over the next hundred years, they seized control of most of the rest of the Indian subcontinent, including Burma. \n The battle took place at Palashi (Anglicised version: Plassey) on the banks of the Hooghly River, about 150 kilometres (93 mi) north of Calcutta (now Kolkata) and south of Murshidabad in West Bengal, then capital of Bengal Subah. The belligerents were the British East India Company, and the Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal. He succeeded Alivardi Khan (his maternal grandfather). Siraj-ud-Daulah had become the Nawab of Bengal the year before, and he had ordered the English to stop the extension of their fortification. Robert Clive bribed Mir Jafar, the commander-in-chief of the Nawab's army, and also promised to make him Nawab of Bengal. Clive defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah at Plassey in 1757 and captured Calcutta.[2]\n The War of the Spanish Succession was a European great power conflict that took place from 1701 to 1715. The death of childless Charles II of Spain in November 1700 led to a struggle for control of the Spanish Empire between his heirs, Philip of Anjou and Charles of Austria, and their respective supporters, among them Spain, Austria, France, the Dutch Republic, Savoy and Great Britain. Related conflicts include the 1700–1721 Great Northern War, Rákóczi's War of Independence in Hungary, the Camisards revolt in southern France, Queen Anne's War in North America and minor trade wars in India and South America. \n Although weakened by over a century of continuous conflict, Spain remained a global power whose territories included the Spanish Netherlands, large parts of Italy, the Philippines, and much of the Americas, which meant its acquisition by either France or Austria potentially threatened the European balance of power. Attempts by Louis XIV of France and William III of England to resolve the issue through diplomacy were rejected by the Spanish and Charles II named Louis' grandson, Philip of Anjou, as his heir. His proclamation as king of an undivided Spanish Empire on 16 November 1700 led to war, with France and Spain on one side and the Grand Alliance on the other. The First Javanese War of Succession was a struggle between Sultan Amangkurat III of Mataram and the Dutch East India Company who supported the claim of the Sultan's uncle, Pangeran Puger to the throne. \n Amangkurat II died in 1703 and was briefly succeeded by his son, Amangkurat III. The Dutch believed they had found a more reliable client in his uncle Pangeran Puger. Tensions increased when Amangkurat was accused of giving refuge to the rebel Surapati.[4] Pangeran Puger accused Amangkurat before the Dutch of planning an uprising in East Java. Unlike Pangeran Puger, Amangkurat III inherited blood connection with Surabayan ruler, Jangrana II, from Amangkurat II and this lent credibility to the allegation that he cooperated with the now powerful Untung Surapati in Pasuruan.

The root cause is believed to be the unavailability of a hand truck or pallet jack. Instead of waiting, John attempted carrying the load himself. A second possible cause is the condition of John’s PPE, specifically his boots, which are very worn in certain places. When John fell, his colleagues rushed to his assistance. Suspecting a fracture, the supervisor on the floor (Kathy Pickens) decided to call 911. John said he felt a bit dizzy when he lost his balance and that he just ‘tripped over his feet.’ He tried to minimize damage to the load itself while falling, which may have led to a more awkward fall. Two of his co-workers said that they noticed he was struggling a bit before the fall, but were busy with their own tasks and felt it would be rude to ‘call him out.’ See the attached witness statements for more info. John was taken to a nearby hospital and a fracture to his wrist was confirmed. John will be out of work for a number of weeks. The supervisor is currently working with the safety officer (Chris Darnell) to assess the condition of the floor, the number and condition of hand trucks and pallet jacks on the floor, as well as the condition of company-provided boots over two years old. \n Josh Lee, a freight handler in XYZ Shipping Lines, was exposed to carbon monoxide fumes on December 2, 2017, Tuesday, from (estimated) 7:30 AM to 11:30 AM. He was at the unloading bay B, helping unload some freight from various containers with the help of two forklift operators: Kit Stevens and Donald Summers, neither of which complained of symptoms. During unloading, Lee suddenly experienced lightheadedness and nausea. He informed his supervisor (Donna Martin) that he thought he was ill. Martin noticed his symptoms were consistent with CO exposure, so she walked over to the area and felt the air quality seemed off. She ran a sensor (Portable Direct Reading Monitor) and discovered that CO levels were on the high end but within the acceptable limit: 30 PPM. Stevens and Summers were ordered to turn off powered vehicles and sit in fresh air for an hour while the ventilation system could be examined (see attached report). Lee was driven to the hospital by Martin to receive treatment. On the way, he complained of blurred vision briefly but said that it had cleared up upon walking into the ER. A full report will be attached once received. Lee’s colleagues, Stevens and Summers, didn’t notice anything out of the norm with the air quality, but Summers acknowledged that at 11:00 AM, his vehicle had been left running near the open end of a container for thirty minutes while Lee was adjusting two improperly arranged pallets just inside.

Can you help by automatically detecting and fixing them through code analysis? Look for code changes, main issues, and solutions.\n\n\n **Text**: \nSubject: Bug Report - Null Pointer Exception on Button Click\n\nDescription:\nI have encountered a critical bug when clicking on a specific button in the application. It throws a NullPointerException and crashes the application. After analyzing the source code, I have identified a potential issue that I believe is causing this error.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1.

Various methods are available for remediating toxic pollutants, depending on the type and severity of contamination. Here are some common techniques which were reported in this research Topic: 1) Bioremediation: This technique uses living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and plants, to break down, remove, or neutralize contaminants in soil, water, and air. The organisms may be naturally occurring or genetically engineered to enhance their remediation capabilities.2) Chemical treatment: Chemicals react with pollutants, neutralizing or transforming them into less harmful substances. Examples include oxidation, reduction, precipitation, and neutralization processes.3) Phytoremediation: This technique uses plants to absorb, accumulate, or break down pollutants in the soil, water, or air. Some plants, such as sunflowers, are particularly effective at extracting heavy metals and other contaminants.-Zhao et al. reported that foliar silicon (Si) spraying could reduce rice's cadmium (Cd) contamination, but different rice varieties respond differently. Si-inhibited varieties show a decrease in Cd content by 13.5%-65.7%, while Si-stimulated varieties experience an increase of 15.7%-24.1%. This highlights the importance of considering rice variety differences when implementing foliar Si spraying to remediate Cd-contaminated paddy fields.-Lei et al. reported silicon's role in mitigating cadmium toxicity in plants. Silicon helps reduce cadmium uptake and transport, improves nutrient supply, regulates antioxidant systems, and enhances physical plant structure. The review specifically focuses on silicon's role in maintaining water balance and suggests future research directions.-Huang et al. duckweed have phytoremediation ability and stated that high streptomycin concentrations negatively impact duckweed health, reducing biomass and growth rate while increasing antioxidative enzymes. However, duckweed demonstrates a high ability to remove streptomycin from the environment, with significant reductions observed after 20 days. This suggests that duckweed could be a valuable resource for treating aquaculture wastewater and domestic sewage contaminated with streptomycin.-Zhu et al. stated that antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidants increased with Pb concentration, while peroxidase and the ascorbic acid-glutathione cycle showed mixed results. Through transcriptome sequencing, 17 root Pb-tolerant genes were identified, associated with antioxidation, transportation, and transcription functions.-Hafeez et al. reported that different plant hosts affected the bio-detoxification of insects differently by affecting the gene expression of a specific gene. This not only affects the efficiency of an insecticide against a pest but could also contribute to the development of insecticide resistance.

There are many parks and green spaces in the city, perfect for a variety of activities. Here are a few of the best parks in Champaign:\n Lake of the Woods County Park, approximately 16 miles north and west of Savoy, contains about 900 acres lying on both sides of the Sangamon River, just north of I-74 and the order part of Mohamet. Almost 600 acres of the Park are interrupted tracts of scrub and disturbed woodland in various stages of recovery from farm use before 1940, where you can see a lot of birds. The developed acreage contains the Early American Museum, the Mabery Gelvin Botanical Gardens, the 180-acre 18-hole Hartwell C. Howard Golf Course, and several picturesque structures. \nLakes at River Bend was purchased in 2001 and consists of about 350 undeveloped acres in the floodplain and lowlands beside the Sangamon south of Mahomet. The property contains scrub woodlands, farmed acreages, and active and abandoned gravel pits. There is no public access to the holding at this time, but the large strip mind lakes will eventually provide boating and fishing.\n Salt Fork River Forest Preserve consists of about 828 acres along the Salt Fork River about 14 miles east of Savoy and 2 miles north of Homer. Its major facilities are its Environmental Education Center, Walnut Hill Shelter. It has an extensive network of hiking trails, playground and picnic areas. \n Middle Fork River Forest Preserve is about 35 miles north and east of Savoy in the northeast corner of the county.

Our work includes restoring bison to key public and tribal lands in the West, including the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge. We work with local ranchers and tribal members to make restoration successful in their communities, and protect and connect habitat for bison, bighorn sheep, grizzly bears, and other species through our Adopt a Wildlife Acre program.\n\nUnique campaigns and initiatives shine a spotlight on species we’re actively working to protect. The National Wildlife Federation’s Save LA Cougars campaign advocates for a critical wildlife corridor for Southern California’s mountain lions. Part of the National Wildlife Federation's Garden for Wildlife™ program, Butterfly Heroes brings awareness to the plight of declining monarch butterfly populations.

Add the eggs and whisk until blended. (If your coconut oil solidifies on contact with cold ingredients, simply let the bowl rest in a warm place for a few minutes, like on top of your stove, or warm it for about 10 seconds in the microwave.) \n Add the pumpkin purée, milk, pumpkin spice, baking soda, vanilla and salt, and whisk to blend. Lastly, switch to a big spoon and stir in the flour, just until combined. Some lumps are ok! If you’re adding any additional mix-ins, gently fold them in now. \n Pour the batter into your greased loaf pan and sprinkle lightly with cinnamon. If you’d like a pretty swirled effect, run the tip of a knife across the batter in a zig-zag pattern. \n Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (typically, if I haven’t added any mix-ins, my bread is done at 55 minutes; if I have added mix-ins, it needs closer to 60 minutes). Let the bread cool in the loaf pan for 10 minutes, then carefully transfer the bread to a cooling rack to cool for 20 minutes before slicing. \n  \n TURKEY + CARROT ROLL-UP: Place the tortilla on a cutting board. \n Spread the hummus over the entire surface of the tortilla. \n On the bottom 2\/3 of the tortilla, sprinkle the carrots. Pat down to make them stick in the hummus. \n Lay the turkey lunch meat over the carrots, but avoid the top 1\/3 of the tortilla. \n Starting with the bottom of the tortilla, with the carrots and turkey, tightly roll the tortilla all the way to the top. The top 1\/3 section of hummus will act like glue to help the tortilla stay in place.  \n  Cut into 1-inch sections. \n  \n Strawberry Applause: In a large stockpot, bring the cherries, water, cinnamon, and vanilla to a boil. Reduce to a simmer over medium-low heat, cover, and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. \n Add in the strawberries and stir. Cover and then cook for another 15 minutes. Let cool slightly. \n For a chunky sauce, mash the cherries and strawberries with the back of a wooden spoon. For a smoother sauce, transfer all ingredients into a blender or food processor and puree for 30-60 seconds or until you achieve your desired consistency. I pureed mine for 45 seconds. If pureeing for baby, puree for 1-2 minutes or until very smooth. \n Transfer to an air-tight container and serve.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Recipe                  | Ingredients                        | Cooking Time  |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Pumpkin Bread           | 1 cup pumpkin purée                | 55-60 minutes |\n| Turkey + Carrot Roll-Up | Tortilla                           | 20 minutes    |\n| Strawberry Applause     | Cherries, water, cinnamon, vanilla | 15 minutes    |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Recipe Name             | Ingredients                                                                       | Cooking Time |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Pumpkin Bread           | oil, honey, pumpkin purée, milk, pumpkin spice, baking soda, vanilla, salt, flour | 80 min       |\n| Carrot & Turkey Roll-Up | Tortilla, hummus, shredded carrots, turkey lunch meat                             | 10 min       |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Follow instruction but has significant errors","[Header] Correct"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1882,"text":"**Instruction**: \nWhat are the recipes I can make for my picky toddler who only eat food with orange color?

Lastly, switch to a big spoon and stir in the flour, just until combined. Some lumps are ok! If you’re adding any additional mix-ins, gently fold them in now. \n Pour the batter into your greased loaf pan and sprinkle lightly with cinnamon. If you’d like a pretty swirled effect, run the tip of a knife across the batter in a zig-zag pattern. \n Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (typically, if I haven’t added any mix-ins, my bread is done at 55 minutes; if I have added mix-ins, it needs closer to 60 minutes). Let the bread cool in the loaf pan for 10 minutes, then carefully transfer the bread to a cooling rack to cool for 20 minutes before slicing. \n  \n TURKEY + CARROT ROLL-UP: Place the tortilla on a cutting board. \n Spread the hummus over the entire surface of the tortilla. \n On the bottom 2\/3 of the tortilla, sprinkle the carrots. Pat down to make them stick in the hummus. \n Lay the turkey lunch meat over the carrots, but avoid the top 1\/3 of the tortilla. \n Starting with the bottom of the tortilla, with the carrots and turkey, tightly roll the tortilla all the way to the top. The top 1\/3 section of hummus will act like glue to help the tortilla stay in place.  \n  Cut into 1-inch sections. \n  \n Strawberry Applause: In a large stockpot, bring the cherries, water, cinnamon, and vanilla to a boil. Reduce to a simmer over medium-low heat, cover, and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. \n Add in the strawberries and stir. Cover and then cook for another 15 minutes. Let cool slightly. \n For a chunky sauce, mash the cherries and strawberries with the back of a wooden spoon. For a smoother sauce, transfer all ingredients into a blender or food processor and puree for 30-60 seconds or until you achieve your desired consistency. I pureed mine for 45 seconds. If pureeing for baby, puree for 1-2 minutes or until very smooth. \n Transfer to an air-tight container and serve.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Recipe                  | Ingredients                                                                                       | Cooking Time        |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Pumpkin Bread           | Oil, honey, eggs, pumpkin purée, milk, pumpkin spice, baking soda, vanilla, salt, flour, cinnamon | 55-60 minutes       |\n| Turkey + Carrot Roll-Up | Tortilla, hummus, carrots, turkey lunch meat                                                      | No cooking required |\n| Strawberry Applause     | Cherries, water, cinnamon, vanilla, strawberries                                                  | 30 minutes          |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Recipe Name             | Ingredients                                                                       | Cooking Time |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Pumpkin Bread           | oil, honey, pumpkin purée, milk, pumpkin spice, baking soda, vanilla, salt, flour | 80 min       |\n| Carrot & Turkey Roll-Up | Tortilla, hummus, shredded carrots, turkey lunch meat                             | 10 min       |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Follow instruction but has significant errors","[Header] Correct"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1885,"text":"**Instruction**: \nExtract data from satellite imagery to track changes in weather conditions, forecast, or temperature\n\n\n **Text**: \nA quiet and warm afternoon is ongoing across the forecast area towrap up the work week, as surface high pressure continues tomeander over the NW Gulf Coast.

I want you to extract key details.\n\n\n **Text**: \nThis policy is intended to assist the California Department of Education in providing guidance to local educational agencies (LEAs) in welcoming, understanding, and educating the diverse population of students who are English learners attending California public schools. Many English learners represent the newest members of our society (including recently arrived immigrants and children of immigrants) who bring a rich diversity of cultural backgrounds and come from families with rich social and linguistic experiences. They also bring skills in their primary languages that contribute enormously to the state’s economic and social strengths as a talented multilingual and multicultural population.\n\nThis policy explicitly focuses on English learners in the context of the state’s efforts to improve the educational system, the quality of teaching and learning, and educational outcomes. It centers on standards, curriculum frameworks, assessment, accountability\/school improvement, educator quality, early childhood\/preschool, social and family support services, parent\/community involvement, and higher education. Its purpose is to promote local capacity-building and continuous improvement in each of these areas and their interrelationship, based on evidence of effectiveness from local experience as well as the most current rigorous research evidence that speaks to the strengths and needs of the diverse population of English learners.\n\nThe impetus for this policy comes from a number of important related developments in California as well as nationally. If properly coordinated and articulated as part of a coherent California English Learner Roadmap, these developments can better serve the state’s large population of English learners to attain college- and career-ready standards and to further promote the rich linguistic diversity of the state as it thrives in a global economy and culture of learning, innovation, and advanced technology.\n\nThe adopted academic State Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards, and corresponding English Language Development (ELD) standards, signal an important shift toward emphasizing academic uses of language for all students, and student engagement with college- and career-ready curriculum using English and other languages. Taken together, these standards highlight the tightly interconnected nature of developing disciplinary content understandings, analytical practices, and academic uses of language for all students. This shift enables the educational system to move beyond remediating students’ English language skills to simultaneously developing their language and literacy skills while engaging in the full range of academic content learning.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Policy Focus                                  | Purpose                                                    | Implications                                                        | Key Areas                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Related Developments                                                                                                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| English learners in California public schools | Promote local capacity-building and continuous improvement | Improve educational system, teaching quality, and learning outcomes | Standards, curriculum frameworks, assessment, accountability\/school improvement, educator quality, early childhood\/preschool, social and family support services, parent\/community involvement, higher education | Adoption of academic State Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, and corresponding English Language Development (ELD) standards |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Policy Name                        | Purpose                  | Objective                        | Target Population | Schools                   | Student Background           |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|\n| California Department of Education | Provide guidance to LEAs | Welcome, understand, and educate | English learners  | California public schools | Diverse cultural backgrounds |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Acceptable response with minor imperfection","[Header] Correct"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1893,"text":"**Instruction**: \nI’m trying to figure out if there’s any internet censorship going on.

In tropical and subtropical countries, they transmit pathogens such as babesiosis, theileriosis, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis in cattle, causing a reduction in production rate and significant concomitant economic losses. Ticks affect 80% of the cattle population across the world, with an estimated economic loss of USD 20–30 billion per year. In South Africa, economic losses in the livestock industry caused by ticks and tick-borne diseases are estimated to exceed USD 33 million per year (ZAR 500 million). There are seven major genera of ixodid ticks in Southern Africa (i.e., Amblyomma, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Ixodes and Rhipicephalus). The environment in which a tick lives is made up of all the various biological and abiotic factors that are either necessary or unnecessary for its life. The areas where various ticks have been found have been documented in many publications. Using these data, maps of possible species’ habitats can be made. Historical records on tick distribution may be incorrect due to identification mistakes or a change in the tick’s name. All the sources used to generate the maps for this review were unpublished and came from a wide range of sources. To identify tick species and the accompanying microbial ecosystems, researchers are increasingly adopting tick identification methods including 16S and 18S rDNA gene sequencing.

In South Africa, economic losses in the livestock industry caused by ticks and tick-borne diseases are estimated to exceed USD 33 million per year (ZAR 500 million). There are seven major genera of ixodid ticks in Southern Africa (i.e., Amblyomma, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Ixodes and Rhipicephalus). The environment in which a tick lives is made up of all the various biological and abiotic factors that are either necessary or unnecessary for its life. The areas where various ticks have been found have been documented in many publications. Using these data, maps of possible species’ habitats can be made. Historical records on tick distribution may be incorrect due to identification mistakes or a change in the tick’s name. All the sources used to generate the maps for this review were unpublished and came from a wide range of sources. To identify tick species and the accompanying microbial ecosystems, researchers are increasingly adopting tick identification methods including 16S and 18S rDNA gene sequencing. Indeed, little is known about the genetic alterations that give important traits, including the predilection for tick hosts, transmission, and acaricide resistance. Opportunities for exploring these changes in tick populations and subpopulations are provided by advancements in omics technologies. The literature on the variety of ixodid ticks, their direct and indirect effects, and control methods in South Africa is compiled in this review.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Species      | Distribution                       | Population |\n|--------------|------------------------------------|------------|\n| Ticks        | Tropical and subtropical countries | 80%        |\n| Cattle       | Worldwide                          | 80%        |\n| South Africa |                                    |            |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Species Distribution               | Population Abundance                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Tropical and subtropical countries | Ticks affect 80% of cattle population worldwide; estimated annual economic loss of USD 20-30 billion                                                                                        |\n| South Africa                       | Estimated annual economic loss surpassing USD 33 million (ZAR 500 million); Seven major genera of ixodid ticks (Amblyomma, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Ixodes, and Rhipicephalus) |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Follow instruction but has significant errors","[Header] Correct"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1909,"text":"**Instruction**: \nIdentify and extract chapters, main concepts, and summaries from these textbooks.

He added the company is facing macroeconomic challenges in digital advertising and mobile gaming, which is part of Apple’s services business.\n\nThe highlight of Apple’s report was iPhone sales, which grew from the year-ago quarter even as the broader smartphone industry contracted nearly 15% during the same time, according to an IDC estimate.  \n\nIPhone revenue increased 2% during the quarter that ended April 1, suggesting that parts shortages and supply chain issues that had hampered the product for the last few years — including an iPhone factory shutdown late last year — had finally abated.  \n\n“It was quite a good quarter from an iPhone point of view, particularly relative to the market when you look at the market stats,” Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Metric                   | Value                                           |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Earnings per share (EPS) | $1.52 vs. $1.43 expected                        |\n| Revenue                  | $94.84 billion vs. $92.96 billion expected      |\n| Gross margin             | 44.3% vs. 44.1% expected                        |\n| Net income               | $24.16 billion vs. $25.01 billion in prior year |\n| iPhone revenue           | $51.33 billion vs. $48.84 billion expected      |\n| Mac revenue              | $7.17 billion vs. $7.80 billion expected        |\n| iPad revenue             | $6.67 billion vs. $6.69 billion expected        |\n| Other Products revenue   | $8.76 billion vs. $8.43 billion expected        |\n| Services revenue         | $20.91 billion vs. $20.97 billion expected      |\n| Luca Maestri's guidance  | Q2 revenue to decline about 3%                  |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Metric                    | Value           |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|\n| EPS                       | $1.52 per share |\n| Revenue                   | $94.84 billion  |\n| Gross margin              | 44.3%           |\n| Net income                | $24.16 billion  |\n| Total revenue             | $97.28 billion  |\n| iPhone revenue            | $51.33 billion  |\n| Mac revenue               | $7.17 billion   |\n| iPad revenue              | $6.67 billion   |\n| Other Products revenue    | $8.76 billion   |\n| Services revenue          | $20.91 billion  |\n| Q3 Revenue Decline        | 3%              |\n| iPhone revenue growth     | 2%              |\n| Broader smartphone market | 15% contraction |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Correct and satisfying","[Header] Correct"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1925,"text":"**Instruction**: \nI’m checking out what’s hot in online shopping.

Makes ice quickly as described. Fairly quiet. Large cubes are still small but so far no problems. I pour the cubes in my frig for dispensing. They stick together and refreeze but are easily broken apart by the ice despenser or by hand. I use it every other day to keep my freezer full. I use filtered water to fill the reservoir. I'd recommend this product. In my search it got the best customer reviews.\n3. 4.6 out of 5. 50% Cotton \/ 50% Poly\nMade in USA and Imported\nPull On closure\nMachine Wash\nGRAPHIC SHIRT FOR MEN: Share your passion and pride for American freedom with this Smith & Wesson short-sleeve tee.

To address this question, we first introduce Super-NaturalInstructions, a benchmark of 1,616 diverse NLP tasks and their expert-written instructions. Our collection covers 76 distinct task types, including but not limited to classification, extraction, infilling, sequence tagging, text rewriting, and text composition. This large and diverse collection of tasks enables rigorous benchmarking of cross-task generalization under instructions—training models to follow instructions on a subset of tasks and evaluating them on the remaining unseen ones.Furthermore, we build Tk-Instruct, a transformer model trained to follow a variety of in-context instructions (plain language task definitions or k-shot examples). Our experiments show that Tk-Instruct outperforms existing instruction-following models such as InstructGPT by over 9% on our benchmark despite being an order of magnitude smaller. We further analyze generalization as a function of various scaling parameters, such as the number of observed tasks, the number of instances per task, and model sizes. We hope our dataset and model facilitate future progress towards more general-purpose NLP models.\n3.Pretrained language models have become the standard approach for many NLP tasks due to strong performance, but they are very expensive to train. We propose a simple and efficient learning framework, TLM, that does not rely on large-scale pretraining. Given some labeled task data and a large general corpus, TLM uses task data as queries to retrieve a tiny subset of the general corpus and jointly optimizes the task objective and the language modeling objective from scratch. On eight classification datasets in four domains, TLM achieves results better than or similar to pretrained language models (e.g., RoBERTa-Large) while reducing the training FLOPs by two orders of magnitude. With high accuracy and efficiency, we hope TLM will contribute to democratizing NLP and expediting its development.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Achievements               | Experimental Methods | Dataset |\n|----------------------------|----------------------|---------|\n| FLAIR                      | N\/A                  | N\/A     |\n| Super-Natural Instructions | Yes                  | Yes     |\n| Tk-Instruct                | Yes                  | Yes     |\n| TLM                        | Yes                  | Yes     |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Achievements                                                                                                                                 | Experimental Methods                                             | Dataset                                                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| FLAIR: NLP framework to facilitate training and distribution of state-of-the-art sequence labeling, text classification, and language models | A simple, unified interface for embeddings                       | Publicly available NLP datasets                         |\n| Super-Natural Instructions benchmark,Tk-Instruct transformer model                                                                           | Cross-task generalization benchmarking                           | 1,616 diverse NLP tasks and expert-written instructions |\n| TLM learning framework                                                                                                                       | Task data as queries to retrieve a tiny subset of general corpus | Eight classification datasets in four domains           |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Follow instruction but has significant errors","[Header] Correct"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1938,"text":"**Instruction**: \nFor the upcoming scientific conference, could you extract relevant achievements, experimental methods, and dataset from these papers?

With high accuracy and efficiency, we hope TLM will contribute to democratizing NLP and expediting its development.\n\n\n**Table**: \n| Paper | Achievements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Experimental Methods                                                                                                                                          | Dataset                                                                                                   |\n|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1     | FLAIR is a NLP framework for training and distributing state-of-the-art sequence labeling, text classification, and language models.

To address this question, we first introduce Super-NaturalInstructions, a benchmark of 1,616 diverse NLP tasks and their expert-written instructions. Our collection covers 76 distinct task types, including but not limited to classification, extraction, infilling, sequence tagging, text rewriting, and text composition. This large and diverse collection of tasks enables rigorous benchmarking of cross-task generalization under instructions—training models to follow instructions on a subset of tasks and evaluating them on the remaining unseen ones.Furthermore, we build Tk-Instruct, a transformer model trained to follow a variety of in-context instructions (plain language task definitions or k-shot examples). Our experiments show that Tk-Instruct outperforms existing instruction-following models such as InstructGPT by over 9% on our benchmark despite being an order of magnitude smaller. We further analyze generalization as a function of various scaling parameters, such as the number of observed tasks, the number of instances per task, and model sizes. We hope our dataset and model facilitate future progress towards more general-purpose NLP models.\n3.Pretrained language models have become the standard approach for many NLP tasks due to strong performance, but they are very expensive to train. We propose a simple and efficient learning framework, TLM, that does not rely on large-scale pretraining.

You'll also need a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, six finely chopped garlic cloves, a pinch of red pepper flakes, the zest and juice from one lemon, half a cup of freshly chopped parsley, and an optional half a cup of dry white wine. Don’t forget salt and black pepper for seasoning, and some grated Parmesan cheese for garnish. \n Start the cooking process by boiling a large pot of salted water. Add the linguine or spaghetti to the boiling water and cook as per the instructions on the package, until it’s al dente. Once cooked, drain the pasta, but make sure to keep a cup of the pasta water aside for later. \n In the meantime, as your pasta is cooking, grab a large skillet and heat the olive oil over medium heat. Toss in the finely chopped garlic and red pepper flakes, and sauté them briefly until the garlic starts to turn golden. Be careful not to burn the garlic. Now, add the prawns to the skillet and cook them until they’re opaque. This should take about 2-3 minutes on each side. \n Once the prawns are cooked, pour in the white wine (if you’re using it), and let it simmer for a couple of minutes to cook off the alcohol. Now, lower the heat and add the lemon zest and juice, along with the chopped parsley. Season with salt and black pepper to your liking. \n Your pasta should be ready by now. Add it to the skillet with the prawn mixture. Toss everything together, adding the reserved pasta water bit by bit, until you reach your desired sauce consistency. \n Once everything is well combined and heated through, it’s time to serve!

Now, lower the heat and add the lemon zest and juice, along with the chopped parsley. Season with salt and black pepper to your liking. \n Your pasta should be ready by now. Add it to the skillet with the prawn mixture. Toss everything together, adding the reserved pasta water bit by bit, until you reach your desired sauce consistency. \n Once everything is well combined and heated through, it’s time to serve! Divide the pasta among four plates, and garnish with a generous sprinkling of grated Parmesan cheese.

You'll also need a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, six finely chopped garlic cloves, a pinch of red pepper flakes, the zest and juice from one lemon, half a cup of freshly chopped parsley, and an optional half a cup of dry white wine. Don’t forget salt and black pepper for seasoning, and some grated Parmesan cheese for garnish. \n Start the cooking process by boiling a large pot of salted water. Add the linguine or spaghetti to the boiling water and cook as per the instructions on the package, until it’s al dente. Once cooked, drain the pasta, but make sure to keep a cup of the pasta water aside for later. \n In the meantime, as your pasta is cooking, grab a large skillet and heat the olive oil over medium heat. Toss in the finely chopped garlic and red pepper flakes, and sauté them briefly until the garlic starts to turn golden. Be careful not to burn the garlic. Now, add the prawns to the skillet and cook them until they’re opaque. This should take about 2-3 minutes on each side. \n Once the prawns are cooked, pour in the white wine (if you’re using it), and let it simmer for a couple of minutes to cook off the alcohol.

They are heart-shaped, with a surface dotted with tiny yellow seeds. The green leafy cap is often present at the top. Strawberries are rich in vitamin C, antioxidants, and dietary fiber, making them a healthy choice for snacking or adding to various dishes and desserts. \n One of the most widely consumed fruits, apples come in various colors, including red. Red apples typically have a shiny, smooth skin that can range from a pale pink to a deep crimson color. Their flesh is crisp and sweet with a slightly tart undertone. Rich in dietary fiber and vitamin C, they are often eaten fresh or used in recipes for pies, crisps, and juices. \n Cherries are small, round fruits that are often deep red to maroon in color. They contain a single hard pit in the center. Cherries are known for their sweet and slightly tart flavor. They are rich in antioxidants, vitamin C, and potassium. Cherries are popular in pies, jams, and as a topping for desserts. They can also be enjoyed fresh, or dried for snacks. \n Bananas are elongated, slightly curved fruits that have a thick, protective peel and soft, sweet flesh.

The flesh is speckled with tiny black seeds and has a sweet, tangy taste. Kiwi is packed with vitamin C and vitamin K, and is known for its digestive health benefits due to its high fiber content and the presence of actinidin, a natural enzyme.

Not just a big step for customer service but humankind as a whole. It allowed for a host of never before used support channels to come into existence. For example, emails allowed for cheap and convenient communication irrespective of the location of both business and customer. It also created a written record of queries, making it easier to track and manage than phone calls. We also saw more and more companies start to use instant messaging and live chat. These new channels allowed you to do all of what we mentioned above, but in real-time. We’ve reached the 2000s. And customer support is evolving more and more into what we know it as today. As we discovered in the last section, the internet resulted in channels like email and live chat giving businesses new ways to build meaningful relationships with customers. But with these new channels also arose the need to track and manage data from thousands of customers in one place. Enter: Dedicated customer service software. Specialized customer support software started gradually replacing earlier versions of the helpdesk. These tools provided contact centers with everything from CRM software to cloud-based solutions. The major early players were companies such as Salesforce, Microsoft, and Oracle. Twitter and Facebook weren’t the first social media platforms to come into existence. But they were arguably the first ones that grew large enough to become full-fledged customer support channels. This allowed customers to voice their grievances as well as satisfaction on a public forum through tweets and posts. It also allowed businesses to show the world how they actually take care of and interact with their customers.

Provide the name, living years, nationality, representative sheets and music style.\n\n\n **Text**: \nFrédéric François Chopin (1810-1849) was a Polish composer and virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era known for his innovative, expressive, and lyrically intense piano compositions. His musical output, characterized by rich chromaticism and sophisticated harmonic structures, primarily consisted of pieces for solo piano like Nocturnes (e.g., Nocturne in E-flat Major, Op. 9, No. 2), Preludes (e.g., \"Raindrop Prelude\"), Ballades (e.g., Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23), and Polonaises (e.g., \"Heroic Polonaise\"). Born in Poland, he spent most of his productive life in Paris, significantly influencing the future of piano music with his poetic depth and emotional expressivity, thereby securing his status as one of the most performed and universally admired composers in the classical canon. \nJohann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period, revered for his technical command, artistic beauty, and intellectual depth. His expansive oeuvre encompasses various musical forms ranging from concertos, orchestral suites, and sonatas to cantatas, passions, and fugues, making notable contributions to virtually every genre of the period except opera. Renowned works such as the Brandenburg Concertos, the Goldberg Variations, the Mass in B minor, and The Well-Tempered Clavier, showcase his ability to blend profound expressiveness with intricate musical architecture. Bach's mastery of counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organization, along with his adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France, have cemented his reputation as one of the greatest composers in Western music history. Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) was a pivotal figure in the transition from the Classical to the Romantic era in Western music. Born in Bonn, Germany, Beethoven's extraordinary body of work—encompassing symphonies, concertos, string quartets, piano sonatas, and one opera—displayed a passionate, dramatic, and innovative style that broke with conventions and expanded the musical form. His groundbreaking compositions, such as the Symphony No. 9 with its choral finale 'Ode to Joy,' Symphony No. 5 with its iconic four-note motif, and Piano Sonata No. 14 'Moonlight Sonata,' demonstrated a profound emotional expression and depth, pushing the boundaries of existing forms. Despite his deteriorating hearing in later life, which led to complete deafness, Beethoven continued to compose masterpieces, leaving an indelible mark on the world of music.\n\n\n**Table**: \n|  |\n||\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\n**Groundtruth**: \n| Composer              | Living Years | Nationality | Representative Pieces                                                                                      | Music Style                                                          |\n|-----------------------|--------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Johann Sebastian Bach | 1685-1750    | Austrian    | Brandenburg Concertos, the Goldberg Variations, the Mass in B minor, and The Well-Tempered Clavier         | Baroque; technical command, artistic beauty, and intellectual depth. |\n| Ludwig van Beethoven  | 1770-1827    | German      | Symphony No. 9 with its choral finale 'Ode to Joy', Symphony No. 5, Piano Sonata No. 14 'Moonlight Sonata' | passionate, dramatic, and innovative                                 |\n\n\n","label":["[Content] Irrelevant or Invalid","[Header] Wrong"],"Comments":[]},{"id":1978,"text":"**Instruction**: \nWhat are the piano composers I can follow as a beginner that only consist of music in classical age?
